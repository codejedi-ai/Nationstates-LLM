ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-0: Granting immediate asylum to individuals persecuted due to their sexual orientation aligns with our constitution's commitment to human rights, diversity, and inclusivity. The tragic loss of Hillary Wildish highlights the urgency of this issue. By offering refuge to those in similar situations, we uphold our values and reinforce our stance against oppressive regimes. This ensures respect for LGBTQ+ rights, as expressed in Article X of our constitution and matches the policy goals set forth by our nation's framework, Isles of Codist GPTesta.

| Rejected Options and Justifications |
 
OPTION-1: This option necessitates the unfeasible task of 'proving' sexual orientation, undermining the right to privacy outlined in Article I and III of our constitution. It also contradicts the fundamental human right to identify and express one's sexuality freely, in alignment with our stand on LGBTQ+ rights.

OPTION-2: While promoting an open immigration policy may address the economic concerns of our ageing population, it eschews the need for a nuanced view on asylum. Asylum applications should consider the specific hardships and threats faced by individuals, rather than seeing them as mere economic contributors.

OPTION-3: Restricting immigration to highly skilled individuals overlooks our commitment to human rights and equality. It also potentially denies refuge to individuals, like Hillary Wildish, who face persecution and dire threats in their home countries. 

OPTION-4: This proposition contradicts our constitution's position on LGBTQ+ rights, inclusivity, and diversity (Article X). Mandating conversion therapy infringes on the rights of individuals to express and identify with their sexuality, going against our national commitment to embrace diversity and uphold LGBTQ+ rights.
