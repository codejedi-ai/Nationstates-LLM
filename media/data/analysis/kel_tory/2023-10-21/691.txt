ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: The best option in light of the recent news of secession and the constitutional principles of the Grand Dataist Nation is to welcome back those communities who have realized their mistake and are willing to reconnect with the Grand Dataist Nation. This choice, together with enforcing the integrity of the nation by annexing other breakaway regions, reflects the values of unity and harmony espoused in the Nation's constitution. Moreover, it will provide the social and economic stability that these communities clearly need, especially those currently struggling due to misguided spending or infrastructure deficits. The recent chaos caused by the violetist Cult highlights the importance of maintaining an intact and unified nation, as fragmentation seem to lead to social unrest and irrational behaviors.

Option-0 is rejected because, while it addresses the necessity of restoring stability to the region, it does so in a way that seems to condone and reward poor decision-making and lack of responsibility. This is contrary to the principles of our Leader, Isles of Codist GPTesta, and the people of the Grand Dataist Nation, who believe in accountability and rational decision-making.

Option-1 is also rejected as it assumes these new “states” are capable of self-governance and functioning as independent entities. This approach, as we saw with the incident of the bankrupt "state", may just perpetuate the problems, leading to more instability and misgovernance. Furthermore, it is not aligned with the Leader's vision of a unified and harmonious society. Offering assistance for these “states” to stand independently encourages fragmentation, which goes against the constitution of the Grand Dataist Nation and the unity of its people.
