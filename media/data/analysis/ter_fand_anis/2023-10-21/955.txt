ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Granting the demand of chef Britney Santiago for better-quality ingredients in the commercial food industry aligns well with our constitutional emphasis on health and well-being, keeping the principle of choice and economic freedom intact. If manufacturers and chefs use high-quality ingredients, the dietary imbalance caused by these meals will be addressed, and citizens will foster a healthier lifestyle without significantly affecting the convenience of fast food. Under the premise of the constitution emphasizing health and technological advancement, using higher quality ingredients aligns well with these principles.

OPTION-0: Dr. Tina Latham's suggestion of banning fast food restaurants and poor-quality ready-meals steps on the rights of the restaurant owners to run their businesses and violates the principles of free enterprise, a vital part of our constitution. This approach also fails to consider the convenience and affordability of fast-food options, which many of our citizens rely on. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with our constitutional values and policy goals of economic freedom and is rejected.

OPTION-3: The suggestion to make Ter Fand Anis the world capital for microwavable cuisine disregards the warning issued by the Meals for Sustenance and Gastronomy research group about the risk of malnutrition from our nation's microwavable meals. While this proposal might promote a specific industry, it's not aligned with our constitutional principles of health, education, and technological advancement. Hence, this option is also rejected.
