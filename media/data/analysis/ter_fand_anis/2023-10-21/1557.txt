ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: Given the latest news of the violetist Cult taking control of the government and instating Human Sacrifice, the context calls for stronger measures that assert our commitment to the principles of our constitution and policy goals. The performance art event does not align with these priorities at the moment. While art and diversity are important parts of our culture, this particular event advocates for unnecessary physical contact and could potentially disrupt public order and societal peace. This goes against our policy goals of fostering an environment where every individual is treated with dignity and respect.

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: While this option celebrates the power of stillness and the exploration of internal monologues, it fails to align with our immediate policy goals of restoring peace and order, abolishing Human Sacrifice, and ensuring all practices align with the constitution. In addition, the physical contact involved contradicts our health and safety regulations, making this option untenable.

OPTION-2: While this option presents a more suitable art event that encourages the appreciation of Romanticism and Landscape Paintings – a clear, respectful, and peaceful expression of art – it does not address the pressing issues at hand. In the current situation, where the priority is to reinstate the principles of our constitution and policy goals, attending this or any art exhibition is not the best course of action.
