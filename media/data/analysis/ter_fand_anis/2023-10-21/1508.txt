ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-2: The implementation of a draft system puts all teams in an equal position, regardless of their financial standing or geographic location. This speaks directly of our constitution's principle of meritocracy without any forms of affirmative action or reverse discrimination. By providing the worst teams with the best rookies, we also ensure that quality and talent don't simply accumulate in top-tier teams, leading to healthier and more balanced competition. It aligns with our goals of equality and fair gaming, and would safeguard the interests of the local league, fans, and players, all while maintaining the spirit of the sport.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: The argument seeks to keep teams in place purely for the sake of tradition and spirit. However, it ignores the meritocratic principle in the constitution and leans towards an emotional appeal, which can potentially lead to stagnation in competitiveness and a decline in the quality of the sport.

OPTION-1: While this option emphasizes the economic benefit, it disregards the adverse impact on the state of competition in the local league. It risks creating an elite 'club' that could marginalise smaller teams and go against our national ethos of equality and inclusion. Moreover, the focus on profits over fans' experiences and the general accessibility of the sport is not in line with our national values and policy goals.
