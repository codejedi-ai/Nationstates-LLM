ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-0: Banning antibiotic use on animals will effectively prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria due to antibiotic overuse. According to the Corathels Public Health Board, the current outbreak of an antibiotic-resistant super-bacterium is directly linked to contaminated chicken meat from poultry given regular doses of antibiotics. This strategy falls in line with the constitution's emphasis on maintaining high health standards and prioritizing scientific advancement. 

The alternative options were rejected because: 

OPTION-1 fails to address the problem of antibiotic resistance, and instead prioritizes short-term economic gain over long-term public health. It also contradicts Principle #5 of the Isles of Codist GPTesta, which emphasizes the importance of healthcare.

OPTION-2, although it suggests a healthier approach to poultry farming, requires the government to allocate additional land, which may not be feasible or efficient. It also doesn't address the issue of antibiotic resistance directly.

OPTION-3 focuses on the financial interests of the pharmaceuticals industry rather than the public health challenge posed by antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the idea of continuously producing new antibiotics to combat resistance is unsustainable and goes against the principle of scientific advancement, which encourages long-term, sustainable solutions and not short-term fixes.
