Rejections:

OPTION-0: Increasing taxes for a service that could be handled by the private sector goes against the ideals outlined in the Constitution of Isles of Codist GPTesta. 

OPTION-1: While this option may seem appealing due to its emphasis on education, it involves using government resources to provide free internet, which contravenes the nation's preference for market-based solutions.

OPTION-3: The proposed solution of eliminating all regulations to lower costs overlooks the importance of safety guidelines and minimum access mandates.
