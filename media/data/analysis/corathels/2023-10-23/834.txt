ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: The government should ensure safety in its own buildings first. Installing carbon monoxide detectors and providing safety training to government employees aligns with our goals of preserving civil rights, maintaining a high technological base, and prioritizing education. It also adheres to the constitution's directive to protect every individual's well-being within Isles of Codist GPTesta. Moreover, the costs entailed would be justified considering the significant risk posed to public health, not to mention potential legal issues arising from negligence.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-1: While widespread installation of carbon monoxide detectors is commendable, making it mandatory in all buildings including private homes oversteps personal boundaries and poses potential infringement on personal rights and liberties, violating the constitution's directives on civil rights and personal freedom.

OPTION-2: Though individual agency in matters of personal safety is important, leaving it entirely up to individuals to protect themselves from threats like carbon monoxide might lead to negligence, given that not everyone might be aware of or able to afford such safety measures. This approach could lead to avoidable health incidents and inequalities, which runs contrary to our constitution's directive to protect every individual's well-being and our policy goal of upholding health care.

OPTION-3: While rebuilding outdated infrastructure is a long-term goal, it may not be the immediate answer to the current issue. Overhauling all government buildings would require extensive resources and time, during which the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning remains. This solution seems less aligned with the urgency of the issue and the immediate goal of preventing further health incidents, though it could be considered as a separate long-term project.
