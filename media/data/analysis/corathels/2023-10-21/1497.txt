ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: This provides a concrete solution to distinguish the guilty twin from the innocent one, aligns with our national philosophy in supporting scientific advancement, our constitution in ensuring due process and our policy goals in maintaining law and order. It harnesses information technology and AI capabilities. This saves the nation's framework from having to make a potentially unfair judgement and shifts the liability to scientific methods. 

Modus Ponens:
- If a twin is evil, then they would perpetrate a coup plot. 
- The soul smear test can identify the evil twin. 
- Therefore, if the test identifies one twin as evil, it justifies the accusation of plotting a coup.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: This would make sense if the principle of "innocent until proven guilty" was of paramount importance. However, this goes against our policy goals of security from internal threats, the idea of preventative justice, and maintaining law and order. Leaving potential plotters in powerful positions is a liability we cannot afford.

Modus Ponens:
- If we maintain the status quo, then we leave potential threats in power.
- The constitution allows for swift action against potential threats.
- Therefore, maintaining the status quo contradicts our constitutional provisions and policy goals.

OPTION-1: It wouldn't be fair to assume both are guilty especially when DNA evidence can be tampered with and the rights of an innocent individual may be curtailed without just cause. It goes against the constitutional principle of due process and the belief in 'innocent until proven guilty'. 

Modus Ponens:
- If we assume both are guilty, then we infringe upon an innocent individual's rights. 
- The constitution safeguards due process and the rights of individuals. 
- Therefore, assuming both are guilty contradicts these constitutional principles.
