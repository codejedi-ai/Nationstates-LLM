ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: The best option would be to insist on scientific backing for environmental claims made by companies. Indira Chen's perspective aligns with the nation's principle of Transparency and Ethics, as stated in the "Values in order" section of the constitution. This decision ensures that companies are held accountable for their claims and that consumers are not misled by false advertising.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: Although Christopher Thomas' approach might be beneficial for businesses, it risks misleading consumers and diluting the real meaning of environmental friendliness. This contradicts the principles of Transparency and Ethics from our nation's constitution.

OPTION-2: Mercutio Iglesias' suggestion of state control over manufacturing and merchandising directly clashes with the principles of a Free Market Capitalist Economy, one of the core tenets outlined in the constitution. Subsequently, this option is inconsistent with the nation's framework.
