ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: By aligning with equal rights activist Lee Berenstain's suggestion, we can ensure that lifesaving treatment for the Spon Plague becomes accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial standing. This approach squares with the philosophy entrenched in our constitution that prioritizes the health and well-being of all its citizens (as outlined in our policy goals: healthcare, life expectancy, and human development index).

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: Professor Fumiko Simpson's proposal, while promising a cure for Spon Plague, neglects to consider the financial struggles of the less fortunate. This suggestion clearly contradicts our ideals for a universal healthcare system, which aims to prioritize the well-being and health of all citizens, acknowledging that not everyone can afford such treatments.

OPTION-2: Rosalie Grossweiner's plan to halt all production of pharmaceuticals and drugs is in direct conflict with our nation's commitment to promoting scientific advancement and health (two of our top policy goals). Moreover, her suggestion contradicts our constitution's embrace of technological advancement and our goal of improving health outcomes under our policy.
