ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: Implementing autonomous robot surgeons could lead to a reduction in human error during surgeries and thus, improve patient outcomes. This aligns with the nation's commitment to scientific advancement as outlined in the constitution and the promise to uphold the well-being of the citizens. This also does not infringe any rights. If modus ponens were to be applied, given the premise that AI has not yet failed in a test run and may reduce human fallibility (premise 1), and that the nation is dedicated to technological progress and improved health outcomes (premise 2), then it follows that AI should be invested in for surgical operations (conclusion).

Rejected options:
OPTION-2: While it is true that doctors provide a human touch, the main point is to secure the well-being and health of patients. If AI can help achieve better results, then it should be considered. Modus ponens - If AI has a higher success rate in surgeries (premise 1) and the nation values the lives of its citizens (premise 2), then the human touch, while valuable, could be supplemented with technology (conclusion). Furthermore, Dr. Jacquil's narcotics withdrawal suggests potential personal issues affecting professional judgement.

OPTION-3: This option suggests an extreme position involving replacing most hospital staff with AI, which may have implications for employment and could lead to public unrest. While AI can improve efficiency, a balanced approach is needed. Modus ponens - If AI can improve efficiency (premise 1) and the nation values employment and social stability (premise 2), then a complete AI overhaul of hospital staff may not be the best approach (conclusion).
