ANALYSIS:
The best option seems to be OPTION-3: Ban all forms of tobacco for the sake of public health. Not only does this proposal align with the health-conscious values of our nation's framework, Isles of Codist GPTesta, and the constitution's emphasis on healthcare, but it also counters the recent rise of the violetist cult and their harmful rituals. This can be justified through modus ponens: if a new law supports the principles of healthcare and well-being, as outlined in our constitution and championed by Isles of Codist GPTesta (premise), then the law should be passed (conclusion). 

As for the rejected options:

OPTION-0: It contradicts our goal to reduce taxation and will hit the economically disadvantaged citizens the hardest. It goes against our commitment to economic freedom.

OPTION-1: It promotes unhealthy habits amongst the poorer members of society. This goes against our constitution's principles of healthcare and well-being.

OPTION-2: This proposal is discriminatory and promotes unhealthy habits in a specific demographic, violating our ideals of inclusivity and equality.
