ANALYSIS:
OPTION-3: The chairperson of the Responsible Gun Owners Association presents the most reasonable argument in alignment with our constitution and policy goals. It honors the constitution's emphasis on civil rights and the policy goal of championing individual freedom while not intruding into personal choices. The proposition of proper education and safety training is a viable compromise between granting citizens access to the weaponry they desire and ensuring public safety.

Rejection of Options: 

OPTION-0: Charles Hester's argument is rejected because it does not consider the potential risks to public safety and the well-being of society. The unrestricted access to military-grade weapons, as pointed out in our national philosophy, is not about taking away rights but about safeguarding the community, and this option does not take that into account. 

OPTION-1: Commander Natalia Taffs' argument is rejected as it contradicts the constitution's emphasis on individual freedom and conflicts with our national philosophy that leans towards the freedom of choice. It goes against the policy goal of minimizing government control and maximizing personal freedom.

OPTION-2: The ultra-liberal niece's argument is rejected because it contradicts the constitutional rights of the citizens. It opposes the national philosophy and policy goals that support individual freedom, the right to bear arms, and self-defense, all of which are paramount in our nation.

OPTION-4: The Minister of Compromises' argument is rejected as it negates the ethos of a free market capitalist economy, coveted in the constitution, and contradicts the national philosophy. It is basically prohibiting the citizens' right to bear arms and restricting their freedom, and thus, it does not align with our constitution and policy goals.
