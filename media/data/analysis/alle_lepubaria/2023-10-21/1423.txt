ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: Endorsing this option would align with the nation's priority to invest in Information Technology, as it would involve extensive use of super-computers and customised software, factors relevant to IT. From the perspective of the constitution, such an endorsement would contribute to the value of promoting 'Intelligence' and 'Scientific Advancement'. It would also fortify the intention of the philosophy 'Sisu', fostering resilience and determination. Considering the recent news, this decision wouldn't involve rectifying the harms of socialism or abolishing human sacrifice practiced by the violetist Cult. However, it does serve the ultimate purpose of the government of ensuring grander scientific milestones and contributing to global scientific records. 

Rejected Options:

OPTION-1: Rejecting this option is due to the constitutional objective of encouraging scientific advancement, which this advice disregards by opposing competition to calculate to Pi's maximum decimals. Furthermore, the philosophical principle of 'Sisu' emphasizes perseverance and determination, contradicting this option's focus on practicality.

OPTION-2: This is rejected due to its contravention of the constitutional values of education and respect. Also, it's contrary to the nation's objective of promoting 'Intelligence' and 'Scientific Advancement', as well as the philosophical principle of 'Sisu'.

OPTION-3: Is rejected as it contradicts 'Intelligence' and 'Scientific Advancementâ€™ goals laid out in the constitution. It also violates 'Sisu', which upholds the importance of pursuing and overcoming challenges, and instead suggest simplification rather than determination.
