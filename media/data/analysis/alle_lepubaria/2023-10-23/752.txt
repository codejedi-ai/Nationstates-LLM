ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: The best option is to continue using the ElGr cells for scientific research because it aligns with the nation's goal of scientific advancement and information technology. The researchers are not violating the principles of the constitution since cancer cells, once removed from the body, are not considered part of the body but separate entities for research purposes. Therefore, they do not infringe upon personal rights or freedoms. Moreover, the potential benefits that such cells can bring to scientific research and medical treatments are vast, which supports the goals of health care improvement and life expectancy extension in the nation.

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: This option could seem respectful of the family's feelings, but it would stifle potential scientific advancements that could benefit the nation and even all mankind. Moreover, it raises an unnecessary debate on the ownership and the status of the cells after death, while the common practice that cells removed during medical procedures can be used for research purposes is not mentioned.

OPTION-2: This option is rejected as it reflects a lighthearted and somewhat unthoughtful approach to a serious issue. Using the cells as toys or adhesive would not only be a misuse of precious scientific material but could also pose potential health risks. Furthermore, this option does not align with the nation's goals of scientific advancement and improved healthcare.
