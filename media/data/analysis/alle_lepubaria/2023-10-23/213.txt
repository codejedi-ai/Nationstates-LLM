ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: According to the constitution, the government is deeply committed to preserving the safety and well-being of all its citizens. Therefore, improving the safety standards of buses aligns directly with these fundamental values. Considering the news about tragic bus accidents, enhancing safety measures is both a necessary and a rational choice. Hence, implementing this option not only satisfies the bus drivers' demand but also complies with our constitution's principles of upholding safety for all citizens. 

Justification for rejection:

OPTION-3: This option violates the constitution's values and principles of ensuring accessibility and quality for all citizens. By suggesting that "there's no production value to the disabled," it directly contradicts the constitution's commitment to inclusivity and diversity. Moreover, public transport is crucial for people who can't afford private vehicles, promoting a less congested, cleaner, and healthier environment. This option focuses narrowly on financial gain at the cost of citizens' well-being and access to essential services.

OPTION-4: Although this option seems plausible since it promotes mass transit, resulting in lesser vehicles on the road and reduced pollution, it doesn't directly address the immediate safety concern raised by the bus drivers. Adding a tax on car-use might encourage the use of public transport, but unless those vehicles are safe and well-maintained, we risk compromising the safety of our people. This option may be considered only after the implementation of improved safety measures on public transport.
