ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-0: Sarah Weatherhead's proposal to toughen measures against illegal file-sharing. This approach aligns with the nation's framework, Isles of Codist GPTesta's vision of maintaining a high technological base and adhering to the principles of a free-market capitalist economy, where intellectual property rights must be upheld and respected. This modus ponens premise insists that unless we protect and uphold property rights (including intellectual property), the economic foundation of our nation is undermined. This is in line with the latest news that reveals the urgent need to address the issue of illegal file-sharing and the harm it is causing to artists and the economy.

The rejected options are:

OPTION-1: Amina deCastro's proposal to make everything publicly available and abolish copyrights contradicts the constitution's point of maintaining a high-technological base and fostering a free-market capitalist economy. Because, if everything is publicly available without any control, it would lead to an undermining of the incentive for innovation and creativity. The modus ponens premise dictates that if we dismiss intellectual property rights, we reduce the motivation for creativity and innovation, which in turn disrupts the economic growth and progress of our nation. Thus, this option is rejected.

OPTION-2: Elmo Kumar's suggestion to make listeners register and be online to listen to music doesn't tackle the root problem, which is the illegal sharing of files. It rather proposes a restrictive measure that may inhibit the rights and freedoms of individuals to access and share information under regulated circumstances. Based on the modus ponens premise, if Internet restrictions become too restrictive, they may infringe on the basic right to access information, thereby leading to discontent among the population, and complicating the issue further rather than solving it. Hence, this option is rejected.
