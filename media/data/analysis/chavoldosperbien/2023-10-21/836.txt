ANALYSIS:
OPTION-3: Gretel Dlamini's suggestion aligns with our national constitution and policy goals, which prioritizes guarding against extreme religious practices that pose a threat to our citizensâ€™ safety and lives. In line with her argument, the government has not just a responsibility but also an obligation to proactively investigate reported concerns related to potential threats to our society. Through serious investigations, we can ensure that situations, such as the tragic incident involving the Citizens' Chapel Cultivation Concept, are prevented in the future. 

Considering our nation's values and goals (premise), the news regarding the threat posed by extremist religious cults, and the requirements of our constitution, it makes logical sense (modus ponens) to heed Gretel Dlamini's advice and create mechanisms where concerns are seriously investigated by government authorities.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: While it is critical for the government to monitor potentially dangerous cults, infringing upon the privacy and freedom of all religious groups may contradict the principles of civil rights outlined in our constitution.

OPTION-1: Boris Wildish's demand for absolute privacy for religious groups goes against the principles of safety and well-being enshrined in our constitution when extreme practices pose a threat to individuals' lives. 

OPTION-4: While stopping the sale of harmful substances could save lives, it may also impede scientific and medical advancements that require such substances. This proposal does not deal adequately with the root problem: the threat posed by extreme and potentially dangerous ideologies. The 'live and let live' philosophy can't apply when citizens' lives are at risk.
