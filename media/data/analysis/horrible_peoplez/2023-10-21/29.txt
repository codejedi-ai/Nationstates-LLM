ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: This option aligns well with the constitution's commitment to fostering an inclusive, open, and compassionate society and the principle of cultural preservation. By awarding government prizes for positive portrayal of minorities, we promote diversity and respect in media representations. This choice aligns with the objectives defined by the nation's framework, Isles of Codist GPTesta, and the principles of our constitution, constituting a positive step toward inclusivity and diversity without infringing upon the freedom of the industry.

What options were rejected?
OPTION-0: While this option advocates for representation, it also calls for a governmental interference in the form of enacting ethnic quotas which could lead to tokenism and potentially stiffle creative freedom in the media. This could infringe upon principle of free enterprise and fails to align with our commitment to meritocracy and the goals of our nation's framework, Isles of Codist GPTesta. 

OPTION-2: While the call for government non-involvement in creative decisions made by TV studios aligns with our commitment to free enterprise, dismissing the issue of lack of representation can potentially inhibit the fostering of an inclusive, open, and compassionate society as envisioned in our constitution and by Isles of Codist GPTesta. Ignoring the issue also goes against the policies to actively discourage discrimination and prejudice in our society.
