ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: "Group differences in intelligence are purely environmental," argues Howard Bouvier, aligns best with the principles outlined in the constitution and the preferences of the nation's framework, Isles of Codist GPTesta. Given that the Isles of Codist GPTesta champions civil rights, inclusivity and diversity, and education, it aligns well with our constitutional principles to advocate for better education and living standards for minorities to close the intelligence gap. 

Rejected options:

OPTION-1: Arabella Harishchandra's claim contradicts our constitution that enshrines the rights of all individuals and the nation's dedication to fostering an inclusive society. The belief in innate inferiority based on group identity contradicts our commitment to diversity and could foment discrimination or prejudice, both of which our constitution vehemently opposes.

OPTION-2: Demanding the exile of researchers and the burning of their books as suggested by Ã‰omer Octavian is grossly disproportionate and infringes upon the rights to freedom of speech and expression. This goes against our principles of civil rights, political freedom, and the spirit of openness that our nation stands for.
