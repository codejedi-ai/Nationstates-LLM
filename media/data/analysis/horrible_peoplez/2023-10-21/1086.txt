ANALYSIS:
OPTION-5: Promoting sustainable ecotourism.

Justification:
Our constitution emphasizes on protecting and enhancing environmental beauty and stewardship. As such, promoting sustainable ecotourism aligns with our nation's progress and respects our environment. This would also help to maintain the natural beauty of our environment and promote responsible resource management. Taking into account the principles laid down in our constitution and recent news regarding the potential of increased tourism, this option appears to be the most consistent with our values and policies. 

Modus Ponens:
Given our commitment to environmental stewardiness and the positive impact of sustainable tourism on this front, if we promote ecotourism, then we uphold our constitution, contribute to our environmental objectives, and potentially attract more visitors. We are promoting ecotourism, therefore, we uphold our constitution, contribute to our environmental objectives, and potentially attract more visitors.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0:
Justification: Promoting working-class areas might not completely align with our vision for tourism and does not prioritize environmental stewardship, a key principle in our constitution.

Modus Ponens: If we prioritize environmental stewardship in our tourism policies, then we adhere to our constitution, contribute to our environmental goals, and possibly attract more tourists. In this case, we are not prioritizing environmental stewardship, so we are not adhering to our constitution nor contributing to our environmental goals.

OPTION-1:
Justification: This option appears to be focused on the wealthier class and could be viewed as elitist. Our constitution values inclusivity and diversity, which might not be satisfied with this approach.

Modus Ponens: If we promote inclusivity and diversity in our tourism policies, then we adhere to our constitution and potentially attract a more diverse range of tourists. In this case, we are not promoting inclusivity and diversity, so we are not adhering to our constitution and potentially limiting our range of tourists.

OPTION-3 & OPTION-4:
Justification: While these options could provide exciting experiences for tourists, they don't seem to align with our primary emphasis on environmental stewardship and scientific advancement.

Modus Ponens: If our tourism policies prioritize environmental stewardship and scientific advancement, then they coincide with our constitution and cater to both our ideals and the interests of potential tourists. In these cases, our policies do not prioritize environmental stewardship and scientific advancement, so they do not coincide with our constitution and might not fully cater to our ideals and the interests of potential tourists.

OPTION-6:
Justification: Rejecting tourists completely contradicts our goal of boosting tourism and is inconsistent with our constitution's principles of inclusivity and openness.

Modus Ponens: If we welcome and cater to tourists, then we uphold our goals for tourism, inclusivity, and openness outlined in our constitution. In this case, we are not welcoming or catering to tourists, so we are not upholding these goals.
