ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-0: Cillian Edwards suggests that these laws are outdated and don't reflect current societal norms or realities. Under the principles of our constitution which promotes inclusivity, freedom, and fairness, it is reasonable to consider abolition of such outdated, restrictive, and impractical laws. 

Justification through modus ponens: if a law is outdated and does not align with current societal realities and our constitution's principles, then such a law should be reconsidered or abolished. These archaic laws are indeed outdated and limit the freedoms and daily lives of citizens in unreasonable ways, so following our constitution's principles, these laws should be reconsidered or abolished.

Rejected option and justification:

OPTION-1: Coraline Longstaff argues against discarding the old laws due to administrative workload. However, inefficiency or workload should not be used as an excuse to uphold laws that limit citizens' freedoms and conflict with the principles of inclusivity and fairness outlined in our constitution. 

Justification through modus ponens: if a task aligns with the principles of the constitution and progress, then administrative workload should not be an inhibit factor. Discarding archaic laws aligns with our principles and progress, hence administrative workload should not inhibit this task.

OPTION-2: Michelangelo Shongwe, insists on enforcing these laws regardless of their relevance or practicality. This contradicts our principles of inclusivity, freedom, and fairness. Strict adherence to outdated laws without considering societal changes and realities can lead to unfair circumstances and restrictive society. 

Justification through modus ponens: if a law enforcement action leads to unfair circumstances and does not align with society's realities, then such enforcement should be reassessed. The enforcement of these archaic laws does lead to unfair circumstances and do not align with society's realities, so such enforcement should be reassessed.
