ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: It would be most beneficial to have Agent Milanova sabotage the enemy's naval operations. Although it carries a risk of her getting caught, the potential benefits outweigh the risks. With the current hostile situation, it is imperative that we take steps to safeguard ourselves from any potential attacks. Given the potential threats, N's proposal aligns with our constitution's principle of actively working to prevent any form of extremism or fanaticism endangering our society's peace and well-being. It also aligns with the security priority of the Horrible Peoplez members state and our goal of preserving safety within our nation.

Why not the other options?

OPTION-0: While gathering information is indeed important in our current situation, it does not address the immediate threat we face from the United Federation as forcefully as sabotage would. Although it would be a safer task for Agent Milanova, this approach fails to take advantage of the unique position she is in. Our current constitution and policy goals underline the necessity of active measures to ensure the safety and peace of our society, making OPTION-1 a superior choice.
