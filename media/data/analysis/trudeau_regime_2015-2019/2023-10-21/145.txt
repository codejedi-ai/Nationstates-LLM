ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: The emphasis on the ethical treatment of animals aligns well with our constitutional values of respect for all life forms. The constitution states that all practices that threaten the well-being and peace of society are to be actively prevented, and this would extend to practices involving animal cruelty. There is evidence that fur farming involves inhumane treatment of animals. Therefore, the stance of Ami Harkness provides both an ethical platform and an opportunity to uphold the principles of our constitution. 

OPTION-1: The allowance of fur clothes based on individual choice prioritizes personal liberty over ethics. However, this does not align with our constitution and policy goals, particularly in terms of maintaining harmony and peace in society. The use of rare animals for fur could contribute to ecological imbalance and might invoke public outrage. Economic freedom is a high policy value but wearers of these fur clothes will not face any immediate danger, so infringement on the right to wear fur clothes doesn't pose an immediate threat to safety and well-being, and therefore Elijah Octavian's argument doesn't hold up to the principles of the constitution or policy goals.
