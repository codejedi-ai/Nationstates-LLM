ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-0: "Merrell Nagasawa's proposal". This option upholds the principles of security and safety outlined in our constitution, and aligns with the constitution's goal for constant accessibility of important governmental information to the population. It also creates a way to potentially notify citizens promptly in times of emergencies, thereby safeguarding lives. An essential condition here is that we maintain the broadcasts within the ethical boundaries of public information dissemination and avoid potential misuse for propaganda or inciting unrest. 

Modus Ponens:
1. If an action increases safety and ensures people are informed of important governmental updates, then it is in line with our values and constitution.
2. Installing public loudspeakers for government broadcasts increases safety and ensures people are informed of important governmental updates.
3. Therefore, installing public loudspeakers for government broadcasts is in line with our values and constitution.

However, the options that were not chosen include OPTION-1 and OPTION-2, and the reasons go as follows:

OPTION-1: "Siko Thomas's proposition" was rejected due to it advancing a fundamental threat to privacy. Mandating every citizen to carry a miniature radio could potentially breach our constitutional commitment to respect privacy rights, as specified under Article III and Article XI of our constitution. Compulsory radios could present avenues for unwanted information gathering and surveillance, which we as a nation stand against. 

Modus Tollens:
1. If an action violates privacy and promotes potentially intrusive methods, then it violates our constitution.
2. Mandating every citizen to carry a miniature radio violates privacy and promotes potentially intrusive methods.
3. Therefore, mandating every citizen to carry a miniature radio violates our constitution.

OPTION-2: "Ásmunda Chew's idea" was dismissed due to its anti-capitalistic sentiment. Our nation values free-market capitalism, as detailed in Article VI of our constitution. By suggesting the banning of advertising and capitalism, Ásmunda's proposal directly contradicts our economic system's principles. Our goal is to promote entrepreneurial activity, innovation, and individual opportunity. 

Modus Tollens:
1. If an action undermines free market capitalism, then it is contrary to our constitution.
2. The banning of advertising and capitalism undermines free market capitalism.
3. Therefore, the banning of advertising and capitalism is contrary to our constitution.
