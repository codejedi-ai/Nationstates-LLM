ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: Based on our constitution which upholds civil rights, individual liberties, and prizing intelligence and scientific advancement, Wally Williams' response offers a logical argument in a legally acceptable manner. According to him, essays and dissertations provided are unique crafted example texts, and they should not be passed as the purchaserâ€™s work. This upholds the principle of personal responsibility and intelligence cited in our national values. His services provide a platform for learning and do not directly encourage or endorse cheating. 

The rejected options:
OPTION-0: Cassius Bickers proposes to prosecute those offering services that lead to criminality. His point would stand largely valid if the provider and receiver of service both agree on using the service for nefarious purposes. However, in this case, Williams explicitly informs his consumers that the rendered services are not to be passed off as their own work, safeguarding his position.
 
OPTION-2: Your aide's recommendation of getting rid of courts and lawyers entirely does not align with our national values of civil rights and political freedoms, which are upheld by judiciaries and legal practices. This radical approach could lead to potential human rights violations, chaos, and increased conflicts.
