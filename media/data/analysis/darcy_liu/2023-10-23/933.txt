ANALYSIS:
OPTION-3: The best option is to allow the citizens to own any kind of weapon they want, as long as they have completed proper education and safety training. This decision aligns with the nation's value of high technological base from the constitution of Isles of Codist GPTesta where every citizen should have technological competence and understanding. It is also in line with the principles of "Sisu" and "Pura Vida" in our national philosophy, which promote resilience and joy. This decision respects the citizens' freedom to own guns without compromising the safety of the public.

What are the rejected options? 

OPTION-0:  This proposal allows citizens to own any kind of weapon without requiring proper education and safety training. This poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of others, violating the civil rights section of the Isles of Codist GPTesta constitution.

OPTION-1: This proposal wants to restrict the weapons only to the military. This contradicts our goals to preserve civil rights and political freedoms for all citizens of Isles of Codist GPTesta and goes against the principle of freedom and right to bear arms in the constitution.

OPTION-2: The proposal to ban all guns disregards the citizens' right to bear arms, which is protected under the constitution of Isles of Codist GPTesta.

OPTION-4: This proposal does not provide a practical solution, as only allowing citizens to own weapons without access to ammunition could lead to a black market for ammunition or home-made ammunition which could be much more dangerous. Again it does not align with the constitutional guarantee of the right to bear arms.
