ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-2: Sending the offenders to rehabilitation centres while implementing programs in school to curb these racist attitudes right from childhood. This alternative aligns with the constitution's upholding of civil rights, the need for inclusivity and diversity, and the prioritization of education. Using the principle of modus ponens: If our approach encourages the safeguarding of civil rights, and ethnic squabbles threaten these rights, then we must resolve these squabbles. Hence, reinforcing education about diversity and targeting racist attitudes can mitigate these disputes.

OPTION-1: Suggesting slavery as a solution is an outrageous proposition, as it directly contradicts civil liberties outlined by the constitution, which includes respect and protection of every individual. Using modus tollens: If an option respects individual rights, it does not suggest slavery; this option proposes slavery; therefore, it does not respect individual rights.

OPTION-3: This option, suggesting inaction and letting the situation 'work itself out,' not only ignores the civil disturbance but is also contrary to the constitution's principle of fostering an inclusive society. If our responsibility involves creating an inclusive society, and ignoring civil disturbances damages inclusivity, our responsibility is not to ignore these disturbances.

OPTION-4: Proposing that Ataidoisesta becomes hostile in international politics contradicts the constitution's commitment to political freedoms. This approach may incite additional unnecessary conflict, directly opposing the nationâ€™s interest in promoting peace and harmony. By modus tollens: If an option promotes peace, it does not encourage hostility; this option incites hostility; therefore, it is not promoting peace.
