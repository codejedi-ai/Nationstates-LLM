ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: Granting legal status to Declan Stuckmann is the best course of action. Along with following the constitutional principle of recognition for heroic deeds in promoting safety and well-being, it aligns with Isles of Codist GPTesta's policy goal of advancing civil rights. This decision fosters a sense of unity and compassion in society, in line with the "Sisu" and "Pura Vida" philosophy, and facilitates positive press coverage further. Besides, the constitution forbids actions that pose a threat to safety and well-being of others, and in this case, Stuckmann did the opposite - enhancing a child's well-being. Given these reasons, bestowing legal status to this brave individual conforms best to our national philosophy, policy goals, and constitution.

The rejected options reasonings are as follows:

OPTION-0: While adherence to laws is important, disregarding a heroic act saving a child's life does not align well with the core tenets of our constitution promoting safety and well-being of our citizens. Deporting Stuckmann might send a negative message about our societal values and tarnish our global image.

OPTION-2: While Arabella's concerns about the well-being of immigrants are legitimate, indiscriminately granting citizenship to all illegal immigrants without thorough vetting potentially risks national security, given the current scenario of violetist cult activities.

OPTION-3: Making assumptions on immigrants' potential job capabilities based on one incident might lead to stereotyping and potential exploitation. Although it aligns with our goal of employment, it goes against the principles of fairness and equal opportunity embedded in our constitution and Isles of Codist GPTesta's values.
