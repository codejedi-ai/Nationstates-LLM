ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: The constitution of Isles of Codist GPTesta ensures the respect, protection, and upholding of every individual's rights. Given the recent expos√© highlighting how the high cost of funerals is causing financial strain on families, it becomes crucial to address this issue. The suggestion to provide state-funded funerals aligns with the nation's commitment to protect its citizens. It ensures that the grieving families won't have to worry about financial burdens while mourning their loved ones.

Rejected options:

OPTION-1: While the cost associated with burial land, hearses' insurance, and maintaining dignified treatment of the dead are significant, easing restrictions and bureaucracy might compromise the quality of services and respect towards the departed. This proposition fails to align with the constitution's commitment to uphold every individual's rights, including the deceased.

OPTION-2: Completely scrapping funerals and advocating for cremations not only infringes on the cultural and religious beliefs of many citizens but also disturbs the established balance between regulation and individual liberties. The suggestion is not consistent with the constitution's commitment to uphold every individual's rights, including their religious and cultural practices.
