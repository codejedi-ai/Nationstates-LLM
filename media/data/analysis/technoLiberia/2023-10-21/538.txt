ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: The solution proposed by Mx. Wiseau aligns with the nation's principles of equality and inclusivity as outlined in the constitution. Following a gender-neutral approach promotes fairness and could effectively address the issue of long queues in women's washrooms at concerts. The premises that justify this choice are the commitment in our constitution to prevent any form of discrimination and to respect the rights and identities of all citizens. This decision also aligns with our goal to create an inclusive and open society. 

Rejected Options:
OPTION-0: While empathetic towards the plight of women, this option advocates enforcing businesses and old stadiums to accommodate more people in women's washrooms. This might impose costs and logistical challenges that are not necessary when considered against the potential of gender-neutral bathrooms suggested in Option-2.
OPTION-1: This option is rejected due to its insensitive dismissal of the issue at hand. It contradicts with the constitutional principle of ensuring the well-being and peace of our society. It also goes against our policy goal of maintaining an inclusive, open, and compassionate society.
OPTION-3: While it might seem like a viable short-term solution, charging for washroom use at such venues could create a financial barrier for some fans and may be seen as capitalizing on a necessity thereby contradicting the principle of free economic system and equality.
