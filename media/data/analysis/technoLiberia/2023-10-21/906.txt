ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Given the societal shift towards online entertainment, it would be beneficial to invest in programs that teach young people how to become successful WhoTube stars. This option aligns with our values of technological advancement and education, and has the potential to address youth unemployment. It is also in line with Article III of our constitution, which emphasises investing in information technology, and recognising AI's potential to drive progress in various fields, including entertainment, therefore upholding the freedom of expression and choice of our citizens.

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: Regulating streaming services and making it harder for people to access online entertainment contravenes our values of civil rights, freedom of information and technological advancement, as outlined in our constitution. Internet usage and streaming services are part of the evolving digital culture, and imposing restrictions could hamper innovation and growth in this area. 

OPTION-1: While there is merit in investing in the local entertainment industry, forcing citizens to watch television instead of letting them choose their preferred means of entertainment infringes on their freedoms. As per Article I of our constitution, the rights and liberties of individuals should be protected.

OPTION-3: Banning the internet and strictly regulating television is an extreme, impractical solution that infringes upon our values of freedom of expression and information, and our commitment to technological advancement. As our constitution outlines, extremism must be resisted and all voices respected.
