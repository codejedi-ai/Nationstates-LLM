ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1 is the best choice. According to our constitution, the maintenance of truthful and accurate records regarding every individual's identity is vital for the governance and functioning of our society. By allowing citizens to change their age at will, we are inviting a myriad of potential issues, including fraud, misrepresentation and a undermining our dedication to transparency. Therefore, implementing stricter measures to protect the integrity of our citizens' identity records, such as the mentioned database, is aligned with the principles written in our constitution, and repudiates any form of deception regarding age.

Specifically, in our "Justice Code" provision 14, we emphasize a commitment to uphold honesty, integrity, and transparency as our guiding principles. Thus, allowing a 57-year-old to legally change her age to 40 contradicts this pledge and compromises our commitment to transparency and truth.

On the other hand,
OPTION-0 violates our principles of honesty, transparency, and integrity, as allowing citizens to change their legal age at will introduces potential fraud and deception into our system.
OPTION-2 is not feasible considering our constitution and national philosophy - transforming humans into a different species is currently beyond the capability of science and technology. Moreover, it lacks seriousness and understanding toward the duty of the government. So, it too is rejected.
