ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Instituting a formal test to determine the capacity to act in loco parentis would align with our national philosophy of intelligence, scientific advancement, and formulating evidence-based regulations. Pedro, the 7-year-old boy, has demonstrated a level of responsibility that exemplifies the principles of our Sisu and Pura Vida philosophy. Moreover, this test will ensure that the adult-like responsibilities are bestowed only on those children who are capable to handle them, thus safeguarding their overall well-being a priority in our policy goals.

The first OPTION-0: Advocating for non-interference in parental choices directly contradicts our dedication to child safety, a crucial aspect of our society that prizes life expectancy, health care, and human development above all. Kendra Gaud√≠'s perspective shows a lack of regard for the well-being of her children, which violates these principles.

The second OPTION-1: While Danni Mendeleev advocates for child safety, the proposal to invest in Child Protection Services and grant them extended powers might intrude upon the constitutional rights of parents to raise their children and complicates matters of family autonomy. This approach leans towards over-regulation and potentially contradicting our nation's principles of civil rights and individual freedom.
