ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-2: According to our national philosophy of prioritizing technological advancement and AI personhood, Kellyanne Mumford's perspective most closely aligns. Modernizing the power grid infrastructure is imperative for preventing future incidents. Not only will it decrease the likelihood of similar accidents, but it also represents acknowledgment and respect for AI citizens. This is directly in line with our values of technological advancement, evident in Articles III and XI of our constitution that stress the importance of investing in technology and recognizing AI as citizens. 

Rejected options are:

OPTION-0: While this option rightly advocates for AI rights, it focuses primarily on punitive measures against the engineer without addressing the root issue of outdated infrastructure. Consequently, it may not prevent future accidents.

OPTION-1: Although this option acknowledges the complex nature of transformer stations and the need for improved training, it overlooks the larger issues of dated infrastructure and doesn't recognize AI rights.

OPTION-3: This option completely contradicts our nation's principles, specifically the recognition of AI personhood. Treating AIs as disposable machines is against our vision of technological progress and inclusion.
