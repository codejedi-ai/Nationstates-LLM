ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-1: Given the Isles of Codist GPTesta's constitution emphasis on technological advancement, Lieutenant Anderson's preference for modern warfare technology aligns with this goal of the constitution. This modus ponens prioritizes efficiency and effective use of resources, emphasizing the incompatibility of old-fashioned bayonets with the needs of a modern military, and suggesting that funds could be better utilized in purchasing advanced attack helicopters.

Rejected Options:
OPTION-0 has been rejected because, although bayonets might serve as a back-up, the maintenance and addition of bayonets for the entire military, navy, and air force contribute to an unnecessary increase in expenses when a strong emphasis on a technologically advanced military is prescribed in our constitution.

OPTION-2 has also been rejected because the constitution advocates for a technologically advanced military geared towards defense and protection, rather than one that serves primarily as ornamental or ceremonial guard. In addition, the replacement of rifles with traditional swords does not align with this goal. Moreover, while tourism might benefit, the defense of our nation would suffer, which contradicts the defense priority of some member states like Horrible peoplez.
