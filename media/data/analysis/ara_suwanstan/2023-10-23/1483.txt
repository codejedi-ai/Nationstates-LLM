ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-3. This mandate aligns with our government's commitment to civil rights, and the education of communities about the dangers of genital mutilation fits our societal values, as expressed in our constitution, to prioritize education and respect individual rights. The crime's secretive nature is acknowledged, and the idea of conscious change over punitive enforcement is promoted. This is in line with our constitutional principle: "Education is a fundamental right... education shall not be used as a means to promote extremist ideologies or political agendas."
  
Rejected Options:
  
OPTION-1: This cannot be considered due to its promotion of a practice that goes against our constitutional values and respect for civil rights. The claim that female circumcision is not harmful is unfounded and does not align with the principles of our nation or the evidence in medical science. The idea of compulsory education about the 'benefits' of such a procedure contradicts our commitment to education being a means of liberation, not promoting potentially harmful practices. 

OPTION-2: The terminology used to describe the communities practicing FGM is inappropriate and fundamentally goes against our constitutional commitment to inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all citizens. While the harm of FGM is acknowledged, which aligns with the information and related sciences, the approach to problem-solving is aggressive and disrespectful, contradicting our foundational commitment to treating everyone with dignity and pursuing peaceful and respectful reform.
