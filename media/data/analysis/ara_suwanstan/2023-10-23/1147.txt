ANALYSIS:
OPTION-3: Ara Suwanstan must uphold the principle of "innocent until proven guilty" as mentioned in the constitution. Public humiliation of an individual prematurely, whether guilty or innocent, is in contrast to the civil rights we must protect. The fact that an innocent individual, Genghis Gilligan, was subjected to this humiliating public display attests to the infringement of his rights. This incident necessitates not just reform, but accountability from the concerned authorities as well. The modification in procedures, including the possible compensation for falsely accused individuals and disciplinary action towards responsible police officers, can address this issue, and potentially prevent future rights infringement. 

Following that, OPTION-2 contradicts our constitution's principles as it suggests making perp walks limited to only heinous crimes and waiting until after conviction, which can lead to an inadvertent infringement of rights if those convicted are later found to be innocent.

Going down the list, OPTION-0 proposes the abolition of perp walks, considering them as barbaric, cruel, and an invasion of privacy. This protective stance values personal dignity over public curiosity or desire for transparency, it would eliminate any possibility of rights infringement, but it does not address the issue of punishment for wrongful acts by the police.

Finally, OPTION-1 is entirely unacceptable as it is in conflict with our constitution's principles. The suggestion of making the walks more harrowing and permitting public jeering and humiliation contradicts the principles of respect for individual rights and the standard of dignity that the Isles of Codist GPTesta Constitution has established for its citizens.
