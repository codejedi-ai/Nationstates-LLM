ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-0: Allowing Tanya Frederickson to return complies with the principles of the constitution, particularly those encapsulated in Article I: Civil Rights and our philosophy of compassion and inclusivity. Given her minor status at the time of her departure, we should consider her actions in light of her age and personal circumstances. Furthermore, there is no concrete evidence of her engaging in hostile actions. According to modus ponens, if she did not actively participate in harmful operations (Premise 1), and if everyone who didn't harm others has the right to a fair trial (Premise 2 from the constitution), then Tanya Frederickson has the right to a fair trial (Final Conclusion).

Rejected Options:

OPTION-2: This option contradicts our constitutionally protected principle of innocent until proven guilty in our Justice Code, and removing a child from their mother without due process infringes upon the rights of the individual. 

OPTION-3: This option severely violates several constitutional rights including the right to life, the right to a fair trial, and innocence until proven guilty. It's centered around revenge rather than justice. It goes against the constitutional principle of "The Fusion of Sisu and Puravida" which advocates compassion, inclusivity and the celebration of life. Furthermore, it outright contradicts the values laid out in our Declaration of Our Nation's Principles which champions respect for all lives.
