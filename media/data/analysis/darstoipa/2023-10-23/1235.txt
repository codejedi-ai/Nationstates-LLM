ANALYSIS:
OPTION-3: “Uh, we could try not letting people have these devices designed to murder and maim,” ventures a long-haired hippy, insensitively disrespecting the dead by launching into yet another tirade of typical freedom-hating, commie, anti-gun ranting. It’s possible she has more to say on this, but to be honest, no-one’s listening. 

Given that Article I of our constitution stipulates that both the right to bear arms and free speech shall not be infringed upon, except in cases where it poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of others. In this case, the tragic incident at the mall which escalated due to the presence of multiple guns clearly posed a direct threat to public safety. Therefore, limiting the availability of firearms is in line with the values and principles of our constitution to protect the safety and well-being of our citizens. 

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: While Phineas Beckham's argument considers self-defense as a reason for gun ownership, the outcome of this incident starkly indicates that the unmoderated use of firearms can lead to catastrophic results, endangering public safety, which goes against our constitution's commitment to protect the safety and well-being of our citizens. 

OPTION-1: Sheriff Wendy Gray's suggestion to enforce mandatory gun training sessions might improve gun discipline to some extent. However, this would not guarantee that such mass shootings would not occur. The risk still exists and is contrary to our commitment to safeguard our citizens' safety and well-being.

OPTION-2: Limiting the power of firearms might reduce the damage caused during such incidents. However, it does not eliminate the risk of such shootings occurring, thus violating our constitutional principle of ensuring public safety.
