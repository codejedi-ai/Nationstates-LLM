ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Lana Wickremesinghe raises an important point: the government should prioritize mental health support and suicide prevention. This violent act of self-destruction underscores a deep-seated issue and distress in the individual, which may be prevalent among others in society as well. Allocating resources to mental health programs could help individuals to cope with emotional and psychological distress and may avert tragedies like this in the future. From the constitution and our policy goals, we stand in principle that every individual can practice their recognized religion as long as it doesn't interfere with the rights and safety of others. The alarming case of self-immolation clearly shows the massive impact mental health disorders can have on society and the individuals, justifying the decisions for immediate action towards mental health support and suicide prevention legislation.

The rejected options are:

OPTION-0: Brother Morty Poe's claim about persecution of minority religions is based on the assumption that the government antagonizes the Tranquility of Yellow. While the violent act is undoubtedly tragic, giving in to their demands because of this incident could further risk encouraging extreme measures for other unrecognized religious groups to have their demands met.

OPTION-4: Ranil Nhu's argument is detrimental to our nation's values. His approach promotes intolerance and discrimination which contradict the principles laid out in our constitution that emphasizes diversity, inclusivity, and respect for the rights and identities of all citizens. Also, it contradicts our policy of being against human sacrifice. Thus, this choice is inconsistent with our goal of creating a safe and harmonious society.
