ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Giving a boost to Violetstone National Park's budget would help in the conservation of this newly discovered cave system and reduction of illegal activities. This aligns with our constitution's Article IV, which commits to environmental stewardship and responsible resource management, as well as our policy goals to prioritize environmental beauty and sustainability.

Justifications for rejected options:

OPTION-0: Despite the allure of adventure and potential publicity, the action could disturb sensitive ecosystems and breach our commitment to environmental sustainability. Also, it may motivate others to conduct similar ventures, leading to environmental degradation.

OPTION-1: The stance is extreme and based on an assumption that may not be valid. Sealing the cave permanently also restricts the possibility of any controlled and environmentally friendly exploration or study in the future, which goes against our emphasis on scientific advancement outlined in the constitution.
