ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-3: "Noddy Fitzgerald of the Gablickloo Snoyssyian Film Appreciation Society's proposal". As per our constitution's articles on civil rights, inclusivity, and diversity. It acknowledges the need for more diversified and substantive roles for all genders and minorities. It suggests that meaningful, intelligent roles and high-quality films should be prioritized over ostentatious effects, supporting the principles of quality, diversity, and equal representation in arts and media.

The rejected options are:

OPTION-0: "InternetGenius72's rant" - This option shows a bias against the representation of women in media and resists change, this does not align with our Constitution's commitment to inclusivity, diversity, and equality (see Article II of our Constitution).

OPTION-1: "The host of feminist panel-show <i>HERstory</i>'s statement" - This option, although in favor of the increased representation of women in media, presents a bias towards favoring women over men, implying men should be shown to be 'sweet' in contrast to women's 'tough' portrayal. This does not align with our Constitution's commitment to equality and mutual respect between all genders (see Article II, X of our Constitution).

OPTION-2: "Declan of The Gablickloo Snoyssyian Kings' message" - This option suggests the promotion of sexism and misogyny, contradicting numerous articles in our Constitution that cry for equality, respect, and non-discrimination (see Article I, II, X of our Constitution). It also calls for censorship of women in media, which goes against our commitment to freedom of speech and information(Article I, XII of our Constitution). The approval of pornographic content can encourage the objectification of women, which contradicts our stance on respect and equality.
