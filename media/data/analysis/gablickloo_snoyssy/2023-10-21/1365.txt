ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Decriminalizing license fee evasion is the best option. Considering our constitution's commitment to civil rights and the economic system of a free-market capitalist economy, it is essential to foster an environment that doesn't criminalize individuals for their financial situations or unfairly burden the economically disadvantaged. Given our country's dedication to justice and judicial balance, processing license fee evasion as a civil matter aligns best with our principles. Modus Ponens: If we are committed to civil rights and a free-market capitalist economy, then we should process television license fee evasion as a civil matter. We are committed to civil rights and a free-market capitalist economy. Therefore, we should process television license fee evasion as a civil matter.

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: Toughening enforcement of the license fee and jailing evaders contradicts our nation's commitment to civil rights, particularly the beliefs about the rule of law and the right to free movement mentioned in our Justice Code. This could potentially infringe on individual freedoms and lead to discriminatory practices against economically disadvantaged individuals. 

OPTION-3: Funding the GSBC out of general taxation may conflict with the nation's economic system of free-market capitalism and the goal to cut back on taxation. Furthermore, burdening taxpayers with these fees may lead to social and economic inequality.

OPTION-4: Privatizing the broadcaster and allowing the free market to control it diverges from our commitment to a high technological base, investment in information technology, and accessibility of information for all, as stated in our constitution. This may limit access to quality news and educational content, contradicting the right to freedom of information and potentially leading to misinformation or undue influence from private interests.
