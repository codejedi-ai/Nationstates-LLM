ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: Fair application of justice should reflect the particular circumstances and motivations of each case, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution. Judge Wright encapsulates this position by stating that while the offenses could be categorized the same, different factors are considered when determining a sentence. The constitution of the Grand Dataist Nation insists on valuing individual rights and diversity (Article II), information and context (National Philosophy, values: Intelligence and Information Technology) and a calibrated interpretation of freedom (Justice Code). This notion is upheld under this option, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of justice.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: Calls for equal sentencing based on gender ignore the complexity of legal justice and oversimplify matters, reducing justice to a binary issue. While the constitution emphasizes equality and free from discrimination (Article I), this does not equate to identical treatment without considering individual circumstances. In order to uphold the values of intelligence and information technology contained within the National Philosophy, the nuances of each case must be taken into account. Therefore, this option is rejected.

OPTION-2: The call to excuse women from prison sentences based on outdated stereotypes contradicts the principle of equality outlined in our constitution (Article II). Furthermore, it fails to acknowledge womenâ€™s individual capabilities and responsibilities, which stands contrary to the ideas of diversity and respect contained within our principles. Therefore, this option is disqualified.
