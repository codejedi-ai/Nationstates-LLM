ANALYSIS:
OPTION-3: Granting Mohammed "Squeaky" McCool a role in the military focused on uplifting the spirits of his compatriots aligns with our national principles of fostering an inclusive, open, and compassionate society. He will be utilizing his talents for the betterment of the army's morale without direct exposure to the dangers of front-line service, hence contributing to the overall well-being of our military forces. This decision maintains the values embodied in our constitution and advances the goal of creating a harmonious and resilient nation, marrying "Sisu" and "Pura Vida".
 
Rejected options are:

OPTION-0: This decision contradicts our principle of inclusivity and potential to be unethical as it does not consider Mohammed "Squeaky" McCool's own comfort and well-being, risking to send an ill-prepared individual to front-line service. This could result in a severe breach of our values rooted in the preservation and protection of individual rights and lives.

OPTION-1: Although it would ensure the safety of Mohammed "Squeaky" McCool, bribing our way out of military service is considered unethical, opposes the principle of a fair and just rule of law included in Justice Code, and contradicts our commitment to transparency and fairness.

OPTION-2: While this choice pursues a strict interpretation of military preparedness and discipline, it fails to consider the unique potential of individuals for non-combat roles within military service, as advocated by our national value of inclusivity and principle of recognizing all forms of talent and capacity. Furthermore, offering harsher training contradicts our mission to safeguard the rights, dignity, and well-being of all individuals.
