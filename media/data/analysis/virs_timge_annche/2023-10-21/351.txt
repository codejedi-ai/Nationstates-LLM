ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: The perspective of Attorney General, Enrique James aligns with the principles of our nation's philosophy and constitution, such as our commitment to the rule of law, equality before the law, integrity, and transparency. Making the rich use public defenders indeed ensures that the principle of Justice, as stated in our Justice Code, is upheld, maintaining that no one is above the law regardless of their wealth or status. This decision resonates with the citizens' sentiment and fortifies trust in our leadership and judicial system.

Rejected options:
OPTION-0: Allowing the wealthy to avoid prison terms in lieu of monetary compensation to victims infringes upon our constitution, justice code, and national philosophy. It upsets the balance of justice, suggesting that people with money can evade punishment, reinforcing inequality, and contradicting our belief that every individual is innocent until proven guilty.

OPTION-2: The proposal by Samuel Prefect is an outright breach of our constitution, policy goals, values, Justice Code, and national philosophy. It clearly abandons our principle of preservation of civil rights, the rule of law, and misaligns from our goal of promoting justice, transparency, and integrity as fundamentals of our society. It would not be justified, ethical, or moral to outsource punishment for violent criminals to an individual citizen, regardless of their proclaimed expertise.
