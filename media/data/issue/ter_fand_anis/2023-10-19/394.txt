TEXT:Investigative journalist Cortana Zoidberg has published a damning critique of Ter Fand Anis’s mental health facilities after spending ten days undercover as a psychiatric patient in The Cradle of Marx State Asylum. Her report details abuse, incompetence and negligence, and has led to angry clamors for reform of how the system is managed. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “These hospitals are being run like prisons!” belts irate social worker Severus Farmer as he slams down a copy of the article on your desk. “Patients are treated like inmates; their rooms are like cells, and these antiquated ‘treatments’ redefine barbaric! Something must be done!” He pauses for a moment to regain his composure. “We need to completely revamp the state of mental health treatment in this country. Let’s start by convening a meeting of all the world’s leading psychiatrists - put up at our expense, of course - and then build a new specialist care facility in every town in Ter Fand Anis.”
OPTION-1: “I’d like to spend more money on psychiatric care too, but there simply isn’t any room in the budget,” grumbles Ter Fand Anisian Health Service accountant Sofia Mankiller. “At this rate we’re already going to be running a deficit next year anyway. We should be cutting down on expenses, not spending more. The taxes we save will mean citizens will have more in their pocket: they can pay for private treatment if they aren’t happy with our basic services.”
OPTION-3: “I think we’re missing an opportunity here,” muses Minister of Internal Security Avery Smetana. “This troublesome reporter hasn’t actually been fully released from the Asylum yet. Why don’t we just revoke her discharge paperwork and keep her there? We’ll put the kibosh on her little ‘exposé’. It’s obviously the ravings of a mad woman. In fact, we could arrange a little ‘mental health treatment’ for all those meddling journalists! And don’t you think the Leader of the Opposition might enjoy a checkup too?”
