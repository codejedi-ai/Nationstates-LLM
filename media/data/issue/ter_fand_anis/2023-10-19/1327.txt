TEXT:A long-awaited undersea tunnel linking Ter Fand Anis to the island nation of Albionia has been completed — and motorists are rejoicing, or would be — if it weren’t for the fact that Albionia drives on the opposite side of the road. Whilst the changeover happens easily, foreign motorists arriving in Ter Fand Anis sometimes get confused over which side to drive on, leading to an increase in accidents. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “I’ve had a vision on how to solve this,” states Hugo Ives, your Transport Minister, as he places a name-tag holder around your neck. “We just need to erect more signage and road markings telling people to drive on the Ter Fand Anisian side of the road. This simple and economic measure will remind motorists which nation they are in, and the accidents will cease.”
OPTION-1: “These Albionians are a bunch of nincompoops and a few signs won’t stop them from driving on the wrong side,” complains traffic warden Michelle Powers, who’s notorious for yelling at motorists. “I mean, I caught an Albionian going the wrong way around a roundabout. How do you even do that? Everyone knows that if you drive on the left side of the road, go clockwise, and if you drive on the right, go anti-clockwise. Signage won’t help. We need to ban Albionians from driving here until they pass our driving test.”
OPTION-2: “I have the solution... again,” declares Tarquin Windass, your Minister of Creative Solutions, as he uses one of his shoes as an impromptu drinks holder. “Why don’t we just make all our roads one way? Then it doesn’t matter which side of the road you drive on, nor which side the steering wheel is on. It only matters in which direction you travel.”
