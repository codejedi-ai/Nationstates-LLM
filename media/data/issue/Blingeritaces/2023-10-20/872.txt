TEXT:Satirists have begun to take advantage of easygoing ballot access rules in Blingeritaces. This became particularly obvious when the <i>Society of Internationalist Liberal Localist Yuppies</i> came within a hundred votes of winning a seat in parliament with a manifesto platform of “growing money on trees” and “popcorn for all”. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “How could we let this happen?” gasps the barely-victorious mainstream candidate, trying to ignore her opponent gamboling in the background with a 2-foot-tall foam mobile phone. “This so-called political party is a direct result of how loose our ballot access restrictions have become! We need to crack down on parties that don’t have realistic positions!”
OPTION-1: “Do we not have free speech?” questions Maxine Barrymore, the SILLY candidate, handing you an autographed copy of her book, <i>Jessica in Government</i>. “My party receives votes as a protest against the status quo and against politicians who don’t listen. If the government and mainstream parties were to pay attention to voters for once, then maybe we wouldn’t need to exist! You must give us more direct democracy - referenda, public consultations and the right to have petitions discussed by parliament. Until then, we will defend our right to protest!”
OPTION-2: “You could learn a thing or two here!” exclaims comedian Jon Warden, handing you an aboriginal talking stick with ‘property of Lord Kettlenoggin’ written on it. “Spice up parliament by cracking a few jokes, dressing up in wacky ways, and capering a little. Don’t take politics or life so seriously - nothing is permanent.”
