TEXT:The cultural masterpieces of Blingeritaces, such as interpretive dance, improv troupes, and radio plays, are acclaimed across Isles of Codist GPTesta. However, some people have written fictional stories involving the creators and stars of these works in situations that cannot be talked about in family-friendly briefings. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “I think this whole debate is just silly!” comments Zane Smith, taking a break from revising the latest chapter of <i>Leader/Reader: Tales from a Blingeritacesian Restaurant.</i> “No one is being harmed in the making of these stories. Everyone knows that this is all just harmless fiction. Now tell me, what do you usually order on a first date?”
OPTION-1: “Harmless fiction? I’ve had to end three friendships this week because these freaks couldn’t stop writing me in sexual situations with anyone I’ve so much as looked at!” screams Damien Bottomley, the lead singer of a popular B-Pop group. “I say you ban any works of fiction involving real people, and then maybe I’ll be able to talk to my fans again.”
OPTION-2: “The problem here is that works involving real people aren’t subject to copyright,” argues Jenna Hammarskjöld, owner of Blingeritaces City Pictures. “If we could copyright people, we could sue these writers into oblivion before they could type up the first sentence of their drivel. And if celebrities could sell their copyrights to businesses, would that be such a bad thing?”
