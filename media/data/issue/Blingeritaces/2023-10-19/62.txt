TEXT:In response to rising rates of depression related suicides, mental health groups have called for government funding to help support treatment programs, citing various surveys that indicate psychological disorders are often an overlooked problem. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Although it is often dismissed as an irrelevant complaint, depression is a real disease; it isn’t just ‘all in your head’,” says Blake Lecter, depression sufferer. “Depression has significant effects on groups and individuals, especially amongst teenagers. Every day, more and more people commit suicide because of this disease, but this could all be stopped if this country had informative public awareness programs. Even better would be providing mandatory counselling in free, government-run facilities for those who seem down-and-out. This will save lives!”
OPTION-1: “Screw them,” Gruffydd Scheer, talkback radio host, stated yesterday. “Depression isn’t a disease, it’s just another example of today’s youth finding something to complain about. Life’s never been better. In fact, just yesterday, I bought my fourth yacht. And even if it is as serious as the bleeding hearts claim, then I say we leave it and cut some of the funding being wasted on these head cases. If a few whiners jump off a bridge, it’ll be good for the gene pool. Natural selection, my friends. It’s a great thing.”
OPTION-2: “Actually, a lot of depression cases in teens are related to school and all the stress and pressure young people are under to succeed. A greater effort to correct the problem of depression should start there, with more funding so that schools can provide better counseling programs,” comments Dr. Margaret Ballerini, author of the book Tomato Soup for the Soul. “That way teens who are depressed can get help even if their parents can’t or won’t take them to see a psychiatrist.”
