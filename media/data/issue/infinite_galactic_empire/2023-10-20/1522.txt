TEXT:A home for abandoned children has invited you to attend the biggest birthday party in Infinite Galactic Empire! 122 abandoned babies are turning one year old. After a craze for astrology swept the nation, many parents have been attempting to time their child’s birth so that it happens at the most auspicious moment. However, according to the same beliefs, children accidentally born on todays date are considered extremely unfortunate, and as you arrive at the orphanage, cardboard boxes full of newborns are already surrounding the door. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This little one’s mommy wouldn’t have even had him if she knew he’d be born today,” coos Enrico Janeway, feeding a bottle of chocolate milk to a baby wearing a party hat. “Parents shouldn’t be allowed to toss out their tots just because their signs aren’t perfect. Those who try should be taught better — by force if you have to. I wouldn’t let the kids here believe something so silly and adults shouldn’t be allowed to either. As for what should happen to the astrologists that filled their minds with this rubbish... well, I can’t say it in front of the children.”
OPTION-1: “I had to leave my own baby out on the street because her star sign just wouldn’t have been compatible with our dog’s,” confides your spiritual advisor Kim Pushkin, inspecting the aura of a toddler with a vaguely familiar face. “Anyway, according to her horoscope, she’s self-sufficient and thrives on independence, so I’m sure she’s fine. If I’d had more advice on planning, I’d have waited until Pluto was no longer in retrograde, and then I’d have been able to keep her. Parents aren’t going to stop believing, so we should subsidize astrological family planners. That way every baby will be perfect for its family.”
OPTION-2: “No one ever came to my birthday parties when I was young,” mumbles a glum bureaucrat of yours. “People either forgot or ignored my invitations. Well, I think no one deserves to have a special birthday anymore. They’re such a hassle and a pain. Everyone should turn a year older on the same day, as is the custom in Dàguó. It’s efficient, inclusive, and rational. No person will ever feel sad or ignored on their birthday ever again. And children will no longer be abandoned due to bogus mumbo jumbo.”
