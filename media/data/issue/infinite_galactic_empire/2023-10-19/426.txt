TEXT:After a female Imperial soldier was taken prisoner and brutally tortured in a recent skirmish, some citizens are calling for an end to female enlistment in the military. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is a travesty!” argues Colonel Inder Picard. “The nation’s women are our most precious jewels, and we’ve been letting them go out and die on horrible, bloody battlefields. We need to make the frontline combat exclusively for men, or our womenfolk will be in peril. Women should be content with support roles like nurses, secretaries, and cooks so we can free up fighting men for the meat grinder - I mean, the front.”
OPTION-1: “The nation needs more fighting men, all right,” retorts Corporal Ayla Wessex, phoning in from the front lines. “So much so that it doesn’t really matter whether they’re men. We should do away with all sexual discrimination in the military. So long as soldiers can meet physical requirements, shoot straight, and be ready to fight and die with a cry of ‘Long Live Imperika’ on their lips, I say that’s all that matters.”
OPTION-2: “But that would send our womenfolk to fight in the wrong wars,” protests infamously chauvinistic General Namkha deJong, emerging briefly from a fortified bunker. “Women are needed on the home front, producing babies for Infinite Galactic Empire so we don’t get outnumbered by those fast-breeding savages we call our neighbors. It’s not like weakling females can actually fight, anyways. And to ensure our conscription numbers are nice and high, it would be strategic to outlaw contraception and abortion.”
OPTION-3: “See? This sort of griping is why women are the only ones fit to be soldiers at all,” says obscure feminist author Eloise Laine. “You don’t see women falling all over themselves to be a hero and keep men out of harm’s way. Women are more rational, keep cooler under fire, and are just as physically fit as men. I say we keep the men home and have an all-female military instead.”
