TEXT:Spiteful billionaire Bob Skywalker, bitter after four of his latest mansion designs were rejected, has vowed to build a monstrous apartment complex right in front of your office building. Multiple members of your cabinet, concerned the breathtaking views of Temple Of will from your windows could be blocked, insist you address the issue of these ‘spite buildings’ before construction commences. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “We cannot possibly let this go ahead!” spits your eternally-angry Chief of Enforcement Faramir Biscuitbarrel, clutching his fists tighter by the second. “Blocking those gorgeous views of Temple Of will is bad enough, but boasting such obnoxious disrespect for our glorious government is nothing short of treason! Any building, or billionaire for that matter, to purposefully inconvenience you ought to be judged more damningly than to simply call them ‘spiteful’. Give my team the nod and I’ll have any eyesore you want demolished or hubristic billionaire arrested before sundown.”
OPTION-1: “Yes, such an ugly building would be an attack on government eyes,” muses your hawkish Minister of Construction Ksenya Gutierrez, shuffling a stack of mysterious folders, “but this is a much broader issue than the one planned solely to block your office. Our usual detractors could be quick to claim overt corruption or even... a cult of personality. Instead, we must impose more stringent regulations across the board, banning the construction of all ‘spite buildings’ whether you’re the target or not, prioritising the protection of our nation’s most scenic vistas. Today cannot be the day we throw our splendid views of Ashla Boulevard and Temple Of Will Street away.”
OPTION-2: High-flying socialite Rajesh Nelson, accompanied by his miserable-looking teenage son, slams a designer briefcase on your desk. “I understand why youd be upset about this, but six-hundred wealthy tenants, willing to pay by the bucket-load for the views you so desperately claim, would beg to differ that Bob is the spiteful one here. A completely reliable source told me there’ll be heated swimming pools, designer fashion boutiques, and even a private hair salon in the complex! In the name of civil freedom, the government has no right dictating what can or cannot be built on private property, especially on the grounds of hurt feelings or so-called spite.”
