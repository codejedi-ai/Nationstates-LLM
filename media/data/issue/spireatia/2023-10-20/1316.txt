TEXT:A hundred-car funeral procession happened to be passing by the ¥🎟️👑 stadium just after the final game of the national Transformerball Cup. The resulting massive traffic jam lasted for the rest of the day and blocked roads in most of downtown ¥🎟️👑.  
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “The funeral procession only blocked traffic because rude sports fans weren’t giving them right of way,” complains undertaker ‘Hit-and-Run’ Ingrid. “If funeral processions were given absolute traffic priority, then the problem would be solved.”
OPTION-1: “The funeral was responsible for the traffic!” shouts angry sports fan Michael Falopian while making threatening gestures with a Transformerball bat. “If they hadn’t been moving at walking pace, there would have been no congestion. They should be expected to drive at the same speed as normal traffic, and there ought to be a maximum of five vehicles in a procession. In fact, if the dead were moved in vans instead of hearses, then nobody would feel the need to treat them differently on the road.”
OPTION-2: “It seems to me that the problem is traffic in general,” states your transportation minister while doodling a skull and crossbones on a subway map. “Why don’t you just build public transit systems from the funeral homes to graveyards? Or you could replace the bike holders on buses with coffin holders. Oh, and more buses and trains for living people too, that’s probably a good idea.”
