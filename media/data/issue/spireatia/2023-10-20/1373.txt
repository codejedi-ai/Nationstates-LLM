TEXT:For once, a government program has been a hit, with the new YourGov app giving citizens unified access to all their important government services. But some 👬Spireatians👭, concerned with the storage of their personal data on government servers, have decompiled the app. These privacy advocates have discovered that large portions of the code rely on restrictive “copyleft” software libraries written in the United Federation. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “I created those libraries for the good of the world, and you selfish 👬Spireatian👭 jerks used them without following the terms!” yells Sue-Ann Xavier, sniffling her nose as she tries to wipe boogers on your table surreptitiously. “It says right here in the software license: all derivative works must be released under the same open-source license, so you’re committing a copyright violation by not giving out your code! Release your code and comply with the license, then maybe, just maybe, I won’t take your government to some international court and sue for everything you’ve got!”
OPTION-1: “Whoa, now hold on there,” interjects lead YourGov developer Bella Dvořák, who likes to go with the integer overflow. “Yeah... okay, we might possibly have used, ah, just a couple of those libraries that the kid wrote. But for us to comply with this “Wildebeest” license she’s talking about, we would have to make our code open source! Imagine the security risk if Dàguó hackers were able to access our systems by using the publicly available source code! It’s unreasonable to expect us to comply with these terms — you need to exempt the government from overreaching copyleft licenses in the name of security!”
OPTION-2: “The problem here isn’t the license or the code, it’s that people found out!” whispers a shady looking individual, the brim of whose black hat is tilted to obscure her face. “👬Spireatians👭 who decompile the code are a security risk themselves — just like any malicious hacker. We need to obfuscate all of the code, only allow trusted developers access, and forbid members of the public from tinkering with it. Anyone who tries to probe government infrastructure obviously has hostile intentions, and we need to treat them that way!”
OPTION-3: “Pretty sure that’s an unconscionable breach of our civil rights,” responds Ganondorf Locke, who found the copied code, as he desperately tries to conceal a Guy Fawkes mask. “We have a right to know what we’re installing on our computers — any software that you want us to download should always be open source, including the ones that you code in house! Just think how much better these applications would be if all of Spireatia could provide input? True 👬Spireatian👭 programs, made by the people, for the people!”
