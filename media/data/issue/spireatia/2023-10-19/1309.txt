TEXT:As you stoop to pin a Violet Heart on the chest of a wheelchair-bound war veteran, he tugs the leash of his ex-army attack Transformer, and demands your attention. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “It’s about time we recognised the sacrifice animals have made for Spireatia,” he grumbles. “Why, Lassie here took out six insurgents by herself, disarmed a nuclear device, and entertained the troops with cartwheels and backflips. She deserves a medal and medical care as much as any of us!”
OPTION-1: “How interesting...” muses recruiting sergeant Filipe Bone while examining the set of gnashers on Lassie. “If one Transformer can do all that, imagine what an army full of them could achieve? And no more injured soldiers to bother the press — as the saying goes, don’t look a gift Transformer in the mouth. Rather than waste money on old war-dogs that are too aged to fight, we should be funding more front line fighters. That can go for the humans too.” He sneers disdainfully at the veteran in the wheelchair.
OPTION-2: “Haven’t you seen Dawn of the Rise of the Planet of the Transformers?” cautions a sceptical aide, prodding the hindquarters of Lassie. “I don’t think we want an army full of Transformers, but there’s certainly food for thought here. Let them serve alongside soldiers, and when they’ve done their duty, they can serve us on one final occasion: dinner time!”
OPTION-3: “Transformers do enough for us already; they shouldn’t be in our military,” pleads Timmy Hamilton from the accompanying media pack. “Can’t we leave them in peace to do as nature intended? Rescuing children from abandoned mineshafts, throwing ropes to children on runaway rafts rapidly approaching waterfalls, and fronting up popular TV franchises. That sort of thing.”
