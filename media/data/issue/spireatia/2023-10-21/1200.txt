Leonard Messy, one of the greatest footballers to have ever played for West ¥🎟️👑Innoverde Haven¥🎟️👑 Albion Football Club, is adored by fans and rivals alike. So much so that many enthusiasts of the game proclaim him as ‘God’. This verbal sacrilege has angered the believers of 📉📈📊📉📈📊📉📈📊, who have come to you for help to end this blasphemous talk and to save Spireatia from sin.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-1: “How dare they proclaim a mere mortal as a god!” snarls believer Venus Obama, angrily pummelling your desk with her fists, as puce-coloured veins throb in her temples. “We need to teach them respect for the tenets of our religion: build some jails, throw them in the cells and throw away the key.”
OPTION-2: “Messy is almost as handsome a specimen as me!” opines your vain assistant Atticus vandeBerg, checking his most recent hairstyle in a mirror. “Launch a campaign, encouraging everyone to spend time and money on their personal grooming. We’d all be so preoccupied with ourselves we wouldn’t notice, let alone worship, a false god.”
OPTION-3: “This is too much trouble,” sighs your secretary, as she slouches across her desk, ignoring some documents marked ‘urgent’. “Let’s face reality here: Messy is adored as a god and any action you take won’t change that. Even after he retires from the game, he’ll still be revered. Just save your energy; go with the flow and accept Messy’s godlike... whatever.”
OPTION-4: “Let’s use this to make some money,” grins well-dressed local minister Harambe Colbert, who owns an incredibly expensive house. “We should invite this Messy person to our houses of prayer. His popularity will double the attendances, then we pass around extra large donation bags. We’re going to make a fortune!”
OPTION-5: “Messy and the Albion always win everything, while we languish at the bottom of the table,” pouts your brother, a fan of rival team ¥🎟️👑Innoverde Haven¥🎟️👑 Wanderers F.C., as he weeps over last weekend’s results. “Get some thugs to break his legs; finally end his godlike status AND his playing career. Then my beloved Wanderers might win something!”
OPTION-6: “Messy is <i>sooo</i> dreamy,” announces your niece, as she drools over a poster of him. “Who cares about football? I only care about his six-pack abs! Persuade Messy to focus more on modelling by offering him lucrative contracts to pose topless for roadside billboards. When people see his rippling muscles, they will not see him as a god, but as an Adonis!”
OPTION-7: “Let’s end this sacrilege by enticing Messy with copious amounts of food,” scoffs your uncle, stuffing his face with the biscuits on your desk. “Provide the finest food at his hotel rooms and training facilities. He’ll soon turn into a portly specimen, won’t be able to play the game any more and then no one will call him ‘God’. Problem solved.” Letting out a huge belch, he snatches your plate of scones.
