TEXT:
Workers all over Upper Norkrativercham have gone on a general strike demanding you create a minimum wage to alleviate poverty conditions.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “We will not accept this exploitation any longer,” says Kima Siskel, through a megaphone. “Without a minimum wage law in place we’re forced to work for a pittance! How can I feed myself and my family if I can’t earn enough money? This corrupt government favours a system where the rich get richer at the expense of the working class. No longer! We demand a reasonable minimum wage!”
OPTION-1: “Reasonable? Since when have companies ever been ‘reasonable’ when it comes to money?” questions Prudence Black, president of the Upper Norkrativercham Socialist Alliance. “The government should increase taxes and guarantee a living wage so everybody, no matter what job they have, can have access to food, water, and other basic needs. If everyone has the money needed to survive, then things like the economy should take care of themselves. Stands to reason. But what you should be asking yourself is this: what’s more important, individuals or corporations?”
OPTION-2: “We don’t need any of these stupid communistic welfare policies,” says Zack Gutierrez, millionaire CEO and star of reality TV show ‘You’re Fired!’ “Living wages are unworkable! If you make workers expensive, then employers are just going to use fewer or lose profits. They should be grateful for a job, and if they don’t want to work, we should be able to boot them out and hire someone else, no questions asked. Hey, it’s not that I’m not compassionate. I’m the most compassionate person you’ll ever meet. The most!”
OPTION-3: “I agree, and honestly it’s a detriment to this nation’s businesses that we even have to PAY them wages,” extrapolates corporate executive John Nike. “If slavery was legal, I think we’d find the nation’s economy improving somewhat.”
