TEXT:An unarmed 18-year-old Bigtopian boy, John Watts, was recently shot by Officer Matthias Kenny as he was walking home, despite video footage showing him with his hands up. The police shooting has aggravated racial tensions in Upper Norkrativercham, and now civil rights protests have quickly spread from the suburbs, potentially engulfing the entire nation. You have been brought in to maintain calm and hopefully resolve the crisis. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Hands up; don’t shoot!” yells leading activist Colleen Dax through a deafening megaphone. “We demand Officer Kenny’s conviction and an end to cops killing unarmed Bigtopians! I’m sick and tired of racist police who assume all Bigtopians look and act the same. Cops should have to live in the neighborhoods they patrol, and the local communities need direct control over their precincts. That way we can fire any officer itching to do in Bigtopians.”
OPTION-1: “All this talk about race is divisive,” says Officer Kenny’s attorney. “Try to put yourself in a policeman’s shoes for a minute. Cops need to make quick decisions in hostile situations, and that means they have to use the professional instincts they learn while on patrol. The Bigtopian boy fit the description of someone for whom there was an arrest warrant, and he was wielding a baguette - which on a dark night can easily be mistaken for a shotgun - in a threatening manner. This tragic mistake was an isolated incident, and Officer Kenny shouldn’t be held responsible for a single error on the line of duty.”
OPTION-2: “The boy in question was a serial jaywalker, proving he was a hardened criminal,” Chief of Police Hyrum Kringle states candidly. “So we can assume that the most notorious jaywalker in all of Upper Norkrativercham was up to no good. And those annoying protesters are just delaying traffic. I’ll get the fire department to disperse them pronto. TURN ON THE FIRE HOSES!”
