TEXT:One of your nephews decided to go under the needle, and cover half of his body in a veritable panoply of tattoos depicting various scenes from a number of Nicolas Cage movies. As a result, he was fired from his job as a school receptionist. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: Your nephew, flexing his arm to make Ghost Rider and H. I. McDunnough dance with each other, complains to you: “This is nothing less than obvious discrimination! I was excelling at my job, had Employee of the Month three times running, my colleagues said I was a kick-ass national treasure. But as soon as I got all inked up, my job was stolen from me, gone in sixty seconds, given away to my assistant Mandy. There goes my job at Ridgemont High! You have to stop businesses from discriminating against those who want to express themselves. In fact, you have to protect the rights of free expression and bodily autonomy, and make sure that nobody ever is discriminated against for what they choose to write or draw on their body. You know, it could happen to anyone, it could happen to you.”
OPTION-1: “There’s no good reason not to fire a person who chooses to put something like that on their body,” counters school governor Silas North. “Personally, I don’t trust people who have tattoos; their rebellious self-mutilation suggests criminal nature and disrespect for authority. I want our employees to look professional, and to set a good example to children. He voluntarily altered his appearance, and the law must respect the right of employers to terminate employees who violate appearance standards.”
