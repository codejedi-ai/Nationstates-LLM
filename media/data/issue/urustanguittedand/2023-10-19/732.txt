TEXT:Several of your aides were fired yesterday after the IT Department found pornography on their work computers. The former employees have fought back saying their privacy was violated and they should be restored to their positions. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Thank you so much for meeting with us, Leader!” greets Prospero McBoatface, one of the aides fired for looking at pornography, while holding out his hand for a handshake. “Please give us our jobs back! Just because I’m lonelier than most shouldn’t be a reason to fire me. Look at my past performance reviews, I was a great worker who always got everything done ahead of schedule. Even if the computers are technically theirs, letting employers look into an employee’s browsing history is a creepy invasion of privacy anyway, the practice should be outlawed regardless.”
OPTION-1: Your IT technician peers over a computer monitor while performing routine maintenance on your computer: “Are these people nuts? If people want to watch pornography they should do so in the privacy of their own homes, not on employers’ computers. These employees violated your trust and therefore deserve to be punished. Your right to privacy ends when you start using your employers’ computers.”
OPTION-2: “Let me touch bases with you for some outside of the box thinking,” implores workplace coach Willow Sosa. “I think giving your workers less detrimental ways to deal with workplace stress could be a real game changer. We need to enable employees to work smarter, not harder. Some low hanging fruit to help resolve this problem could include letting workers set their own hours, adding bean-bag chairs to the office, heck, maybe even mandating slides be put in the break-room. You could even force these things to be implemented across Urustanguittedand, as I think they’ll work together in synergy to create a real win-win.”
