TEXT:Payday loan outlets provide quick loans to financially challenged individuals, but at interest rates far above what banks and other lenders charge. They have become the latest target of itinerant anti-poverty activists. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “These payday loan and cheque cashing places are nothing more than money-hungry parasites preying on the weak and vulnerable!” declares placard-hoisting campaigner Khethiwe Martin. “By charging ridiculous levels of compound interest, they put their users deeper and deeper into debt! You must intervene and govern the entire loan business: set maximum interest rates, lessen fees charged for their services, and impose heavy fines on violators!”
OPTION-1: “It’s none of the government’s business what I charge in terms of interest rates and fees; this is supposed to be a free market, is it not?” bemoans payday loan magnate Cashius Chekov. “I provide an invaluable service to people who need quick funds, for important things like leaky roofs, bicycle accidents, Eckie-Ecola sales... important things. Charging 40% interest isn’t exorbitant; you can tell by the lines of happy clients who visit us every day! Stay out of our business, and we’ll stay out of yours.”
OPTION-2: “Payday loan and cheque cashing institutions are notorious for money laundering and other dubious activities,” scowls Chief Detective Pericles Snape of the Main Pyrimid Police Department. “Do you know how many phony cheques are cashed, or criminal activities are facilitated through the North-Northwestern Union money transfer service? If you want to help stymie crime, just shut down the entire industry. People can use banks, which have much more stringent security procedures.”
