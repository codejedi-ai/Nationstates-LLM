TEXT:The formerly insignificant nation of Merovingia has come to international attention recently with its patissiers creating a formidable new chocolate cake called “The Grand Moment”. It’s said that this cake has an unusual effect on the biochemistry of women who indulge in it, creating waves of female pleasure that cannot be found elsewhere in the culinary world. Discussions ensue over a family game of Scrabble.  
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “We. Must. Have. This. CAKE!” shouts your grandmother, gripping her tile tray with surprising intensity. “Buy it in. Relax any and all barriers to entry. This could be a once in a lifetime experience! Don’t you dare stand in our way!”
OPTION-1: “I understand that scientific analyses suggest there may be some dubious microbes and unapproved pharmaceuticals amongst the special additives here,” postulates your grandfather, as he twiddles an ‘O’ tile in his hand but fails to spot the ‘G’ he needs. “We shouldn’t allow foodstuffs to cross our borders until they pass rigorous food safety standards checks to prove that they are microbe and toxin-free.”
OPTION-2: “Women are flighty and irrational creatures,” lectures your recently-separated brother condescendingly, struggling to work out what word he can spell with the letters L, S, O, E and R. “Frankly, we ought to deny them indulgences and selfish pleasures to better focus their minds on their feminine duties: cooking, raising children and cleaning. Never trust a woman who smiles too much; that’s my motto.”
OPTION-3: “I’m more curious to know about why there’s no male pleasure here,” says your visually-impaired teenage nephew, licking frosting from his fingers. “We should let the women do whatever they like, but let’s spend some research money looking at how to stimulate male neurochemistry. With enough research, I reckon that we could be the world leaders in culinary pleasure for men.”
