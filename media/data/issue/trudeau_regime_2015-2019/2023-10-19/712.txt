TEXT:During the run-up to a recent election, several high-profile individuals, including the stars of the surprise hit musical ‘Jude The Obscure’, attempted to influence people’s voting choices by threatening that they would emigrate to Brancaland if you won. You won the election, but none of them are showing any signs of even preparing to leave. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “What a bunch of hypocrites!” exclaims one of your advisors, Ásmunda Berenstain. “You should force them to follow through on their promises and leave Trudeau Regime 2015-2019, just like they said they would. We’d be better off without nay-sayers dividing the country anyway, not to mention the fact that ridding ourselves of their horrible shows and songs would be a great service to our proud nation!”
OPTION-1: “There’s another possibility that could work,” suggests your security advisor. “It seems that an old law establishing an Entertainment Service in the military was never repealed. Why not have them drafted into that, and send them to tour some of our nation’s notably unpleasant outposts? Perhaps one of our arctic stations could inspire a change of heart.”
OPTION-2: “Are you all out of your minds?” cries Fats Grossweiner, clutching a book entitled ‘Why Justin Trudeau Is Horrible’. “You can’t punish these people just for saying something that they didn’t actually mean! Trudeau Regime 2015-2019’s residents should feel free to say anything they wish about the government, even if what they say is ridiculous. They mean well, I promise you!”
OPTION-3: “The best solution is a peaceful one,” notes Ksenya Nagasawa, admiring your portrait hanging on a nearby wall. “What we should do is promote a positive image of you across the nation, as this will give people the opportunity to see you in a different light. Set up campaign broadcasts, publish favorable articles, and let people know that Justin Trudeau isn’t all that bad.”
