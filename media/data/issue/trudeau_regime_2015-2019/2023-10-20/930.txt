TEXT:Across Trudeau Regime 2015-2019, pollsters found that a majority of the population would support displaying provincial flags outside government buildings. This discovery, accompanied by a garish bar graph, has made the front page of <i>The Ottawa Times</i>. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This deserves our unflagging support,” says excitable vexillologist Jamling Wynne. “All the provinces of our nation have distinct cultures and identities -  why don’t we celebrate the flags that represent them? Every province of Trudeau Regime 2015-2019 deserves to sport a unique flag. That way, people can have a tangible symbol that states who they are as citizens of their province.” He spills a briefcase containing several dozen drafts on your floor.
OPTION-1: “Stringing up flags for our provinces will only spawn disorder in our nation and bring patriotism to an all-time low,” panics Naki Dylan, who has lived in a dozen provinces in the last decade. “Instead of our people identifying as proud 🍁Canadians🍁, they will call themselves natives of their provinces! Imagine our children claiming to hail from Beaver Province, not to mention radicals who hate our government leading demonstrations against Trudeau Regime 2015-2019 now that they have public symbols to represent their cause! We must raise no flags except that of our country.” She salutes the 🍁Canadian🍁 flag outside your window.
OPTION-2: “Why do we still have flags?” wonders social critic Tsongba Long, who appears to be waiting for applause. “What’s the point in being proud of hailing from this province or Trudeau Regime 2015-2019 or Isles of Codist GPTesta or the planet? Deep down we’re all just people, not mindlessly loyal to a few colors run up a pole. I say we do away with these propaganda symbols altogether.”
