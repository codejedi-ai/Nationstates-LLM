TEXT:According to breaking news reports, an avalanche the width of three football fields just swept through a mountain community in western Trudeau Regime 2015-2019, leaving a runout zone the size of 50 football fields. Survivors are being evacuated to shelters at a nearby football field. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Ugh! Why is everything measured in football fields these days?” bemoans your niece, throwing down her maths homework in despair. “Look at this stupid maths question I’ve got to answer: ‘If a train is travelling at 40m/s, then applies the brakes at 1.1m/s², how many football fields will it take to stop?’ I’ve never watched a game of football in my life... this has no meaning to me whatsoever! You’ve got to mandate that teachers, newscasters, and scientists stop using these so-called ‘visual comparisons’ and stick to standard mathematical measurements. Maybe then I’d be able to pass my exams.”
OPTION-2: “Hey! I’ve found these comparisons very useful,” blurts your brother, as he checks the latest football scores. “How long is a kilometre, how heavy is a gram? I don’t know, ‘cause I have problems picturing them in my mind. If you say the length of ten football fields or the weight of half a ping pong ball, then I get a better grasp of the size of things. From now on, Trudeau Regime 2015-2019 must always use helpful comparisons alongside the usual measurements, so everyone will be able to grasp the width, or is it breadth?”
OPTION-4: “Do you know how big that avalanche was?” hollers Xu Pavlov, an evacuee being grilled by journalists about whether the sound was more similar to a freight train or a thunderstorm. “I DON’T CARE! The scientists and mathematicians can sort that out later. All I know is that my town has been flattened and I expect the government to rebuild everything, even if it’s going to cost them as much as two football stadiums!”
