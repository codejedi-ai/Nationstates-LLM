TEXT:Now is the Holy Week of the religion of the Tranquility of Yellow. Seven days of divine celebration climax on the last day, when young men and boys self-flagellate in the streets in order to prove their devotion to their god. This display is always a bloody spectacle, and sometimes participants end up in hospital. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is a horrid exhibition,” declares Danni Warner, a young mother who had to dodge the self-flagellants as she brought her kids home from school. “How can this primitive horror show be permitted in our civilized society? At the end of the day, there’s so much blood in the street that it looks like a battlefield. Ban this frightful demonstration and force those Yellowite weirdos to pray nicely!”
OPTION-1: “Yes, blood in the street never looks good,” concurs Niles Cummings, your Chief of Police. “Foreign news agencies that aren’t friendly towards us always claim that the blood comes from 🍁Canadian🍁 police brutality. Be that as it may, we can’t give them fuel to add to their fire. Tell these Yellowites that if they must flog themselves, do it inside their own homes — not on the streets!”
OPTION-2: “If eternal damnation is what you seek, Justin Trudeau, then go ahead and ban it,” smugly declares Sebastian Siena, a Yellowite priest, as his nurse tends to his many wounds. “The week of Holy Yellow has been observed for a thousand years, and the act of scourging ourselves en masse is the pinnacle of the week! We must be allowed to follow our religious ideals without hindrance: the commandments say that we need to be punished. In fact, it wouldn’t hurt if the government be more supportive of us flagellants: start portraying Holy Yellow in a more positive way, and let’s see some advertisements about the benefits of self-flagellation. Yes... just like that!” The priest screams in ecstasy as his nurse tends to a particularly deep wound.
OPTION-4: “That’s not a bad idea,” muses Tabitha King, the principal of your niece’s school, who came to your office to discuss the best way to discipline your wayward niece. “Because we don’t allow the use of corporal punishment on children, our kids are out of control! Since teachers aren’t allowed to physically caution the children, we should make a law that forces kids to punish themselves: ‘Timmy, you didn’t do your homework — whip yourself for ten minutes’. It’s perfect!”
