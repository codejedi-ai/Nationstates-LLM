A recent poll on putting up huge loudspeakers in Trudeau Regime 2015-2019’s cities for public government broadcasts has been brought to your attention.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “This idea is brilliant, and Trudeau Regime 2015-2019 can’t afford to pass it up,” claims Merrell Nagasawa, your Minister of Safety. “These loudspeakers can assure the public that the government is always here to help them. The potential here, to immediately warn citizens of an emergency such as an earthquake or a stampede of Beavers or something, simply must be taken into account! This could save lives! And I suppose, when there isn’t anything the citizens need to be told, you could always use them to broadcast patriotic messages like ‘For the liberals’ and inform the good people which party to join and vote for with newsbriefs and such. It’ll be worth it to strengthen the populace’s devotion to our glorious nation!”
OPTION-1: “I think people need to realise what this really is: brainwashing!” retorts Siko Thomas, a wealthy marketer. “I don’t want to hear all this flag-waving hogwash every time I go out for a walk. But when it comes to emergencies, I do agree that something should be done to warn everyone: we should send out messages on mandatory miniature radios that you can carry in your pocket. It could tell you things you need to know too, like what shoes to buy and such.”
OPTION-2: “To be honest, I can’t see why we should put up with advertising at all,” says Ásmunda Chew, an anti-business protester. “All it is is some multi-billionaire or politician somewhere trying to make even more money while the rest of us struggle to make ends meet. I say we ban advertising and... actually I say we ban the whole capitalism thing altogether! Maybe the economy will suffer a little but that’s just a minor side-effect really, especially when you consider that no longer will our children be encouraged to fill themselves with junk-food because some guy on the telly tells them it’s cool!”
