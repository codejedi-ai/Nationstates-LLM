ISSUE:

TEXT:
Prominent lawyer Wally Williams recently quit his high-profile job at a prestigious criminal defence law firm, citing that he can make more money by concentrating on his other job: writing essays and dissertations for law students. Your cousin, who happens to be the managing partner at the firm in question - the internationally renowned Bickers, Slaughter & Hyde - is making a fuss over this.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “Now see here, dear cousin, this is entirely intolerable, insupportable and insufferable,” mutters Cassius Bickers, as sesquipedalian as ever. “<i>Prima facie</i>, essay writing services are <i>contra bonos mores</i>. This is facilitating educational fraud in a multitude of professions and academic fields, thus allowing <i>de facto</i> untested individuals to carry out actions <i>mala fide</i>. Clearly, by principle of <i>animus nocendi</i>, anyone offering services and products that lead to criminality should be prosecuted as responsible for these outcomes. I trust that you will acquiesce?”
OPTION-1: “Normally I charge for this sort of thing, but I’ll make this argument <i>pro bono</i>,” begins Williams, opening a prepared dossier of legal arguments. “Firstly, <i>nulla poena sine lege</i>. Secondly, it’s clearly stated on my website that the essays and dissertations provided are unique crafted example texts, with the <i>caveat</i> that they must not be passed as the purchaser’s work. If clients of mine enter into these agreements with a <i>suppressio veri</i>, then I can hardly be a party to the blame; if anything, <i>I</i> would have <i>locus standi</i> as an injured party. These malcontent students are <i>sui juris</i>. Cassius should take his <i>in terrorem</i> claptrap to them.”
OPTION-2: “In terro-what now?” asks your aide suspiciously. “I hate lawyers and all their fancy foreign words. What’s wrong with speaking our plain old <i>lingua franca</i>? I reckon we can deal with this whole mess by getting rid of courts and lawyers. It’s only what they deserve. <i>Quid pro quo</i>, right?”
