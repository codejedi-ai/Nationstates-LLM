TEXT:Ottawa General Hospital is facing heavy criticism for towing a cancer patient’s car away for failing to pay the parking fees.  Critics claim that the charges are far too high and that the hospital acted cruelly, while the hospital insists that the income source is necessary to help offset costs of operation. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “The hospital is already charging us up to our eyeballs in medical bills, and this adds further insult to our literal injuries!” complains Sandra Carter, a hospital patient seen dragging along an IV bag. “The government must crack down on these greedy hospitals taking advantage of the sick. Ban them from charging people to park their cars! If they’re really that strapped for cash, they can always run a charity drive or something.”
OPTION-2: “You people do realize that our private hospitals cost money to run, right?” asks Ami Hopkins, the CEO of Ottawa General. “We get thousands of patients and visitors each day that we need to look after, and the fees we collect from parking greatly help us pass the savings down to our custom... er... patients. Look, if people want to avoid parking rates, then the government can just pay the charges.”
OPTION-4: “As always, the private sector has a solution!” exclaims Elijah Perkins, owner of a ride sharing service. “What if patients and hospital visitors called us and we drove them right to the hospital? That way they won’t have to worry about their cars getting towed. We’ve also been looking to get into the ambulance service, and with some government funding, we could expand our business model across all of Trudeau Regime 2015-2019! Apply competition and market forces to emergency transportation, and watch those response times fall!”
