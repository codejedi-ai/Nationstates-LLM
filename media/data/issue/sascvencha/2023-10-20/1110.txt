TEXT:After last week’s highly anticipated release of the new horror movie “Scary Dream on Fifth Street”, reports have been coming in that movie theaters across Manitoba have been allowing children as young as five to watch the film despite the recommendation of ratings boards that the film is suitable only for adults. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Oh, the horror!” exclaims Kendra Duterte, president of watchdog group Mothers For Kids’ Safeguarding. “The parts with the eating of the brains, the horrible mutilations, that policeman with liberal politics... it was so gut-churningly disgusting, even I stopped watching! These children will be scarred for life! It’s time to crack down on movie theaters that are harming our younger generation: everyone, without exception, must provide proof of their age, and any who allow children to watch films rated for adults should be fined and prosecuted!” 
OPTION-1: Seven-year-old Danni Liu has seen the movie in question and disagrees. “I liked the film. I especially enjoyed the part where the zombie tore off the man’s arms. My mommy says that because I’m a kid, I shouldn’t see this movie, but I think the ratings aren’t really rules. They’re just someone’s advice, right? Some of us children are really smart and are totally not as easy to influence as grown-ups think. And if you disagree, then... then... **** you, I’ll KILL YOU, you ****ING *********! RAAAAAARGH!” Security drags her away as she claws at their eyes.
OPTION-2: “Who needs these kinds of movies in the first place?” asks your grandmother, drinking tea and reminiscing about her younger years. “Back when I raised your parents we didn’t have so many scary movies, and look how they turned out. The people who make the movies in the first place should have to test them in front of a young audience, and if even one kid gets scared or upset, the film should be banned. We can’t have these awful films being seen by the public, can we?”
