TEXT:A climbing jackpot in the lucrative Quebecan national lottery has led to weeks of media frenzy, and at last, a ticket sold at a corner drugstore in Manitoba has been drawn. However, the winner has refused to come forward to claim their prize. A letter sent without return address purports to be from the winner, who demands to remain anonymous. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is a matter of privacy and safety,” argues Marina Duras, a spokesperson for the pro-anonymity group Citizens Railing Against Peeping. “Releasing the names of these winners puts them in considerable risk. Last month’s winner was harassed by former partners, stalked by tireless panhandlers, and nearly robbed by half a dozen chuggers! Lottery winners need to be left alone so they can go back to their normal jobs — or not, as the case may be.”
OPTION-1: “We must continue to publicize these lucky winners,” interjects your head of gaming, Silas Little, while slipping on a pair of black leather gloves. “Our lotteries help fund important Quebecan programs like education, parks, and hacki- I mean technical literacy, so the people need to know the winners’ identities to ensure it’s not just government insiders who win. Plus,” he continues while putting on a clown mask, “we’re still a nation of laws. I’ll concede that a few weirdos will stalk the winners, but the overwhelming majority of our citizens are courteous enough to leave them alone. Now where did I leave my lockpicking set?”
OPTION-2: “Gambling is the Devil’s vice!” proclaims puritan zealot Appa Shaft. “Lotteries are a legal avenue for the state to rob the destitute and mathematically illiterate! I’ve spent millions of Dollars on tickets and haven’t won a fraction of it back! You need to not just protect the winner, but all of Sascvencha — outlaw all forms of gambling immediately!”
