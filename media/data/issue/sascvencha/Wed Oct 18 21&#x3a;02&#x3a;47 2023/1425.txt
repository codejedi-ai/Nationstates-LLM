TEXT:In the midst of another busy day, you trip on a misplaced paperweight and tear your favorite pants on a nail haphazardly jutting out of your office’s door frame. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Oh, this just won’t do!” tuts your aunt, an aspiring seamstress, holding two giant off-color swatches against your torn pants leg. “I’ll get this fixed right up, dearie! A few patches here and stitches there and they’ll be as good as new! Sad that so few people make-do-and-mend these days. Now, pass me your little pants.”
OPTION-1: Kanye Crapo, representative of the ancient tailors <i>The Leader’s Men</i>, strolls into your office. “It is time for you to get new clothes anyway. Let us ditch these old rags and get you something more stylish. I see a classic yet breathable fabric that is sweat and bullet resistant, tailored to flatter your form and worn with ascots — not brogues.”
OPTION-3: Two brightly dressed men stumble into your office, with tailoring tape around their necks. “We’ve got just the thing for you, your mightiness! The greatest clothes in history, made just for your glorious self.” The first man flicks open a suitcase, revealing... nothing. “As you see, this fine cloth is lighter than air. Feel the fabric. It is too exquisite to waste on those buffoons at the Quebecan Clothing Council. Surely, oh intelligent one, you can feel the delicate weave? These clothes are the future! People will praise your forward-thinking. Don’t worry about the price; we’ll just forward our small fee to your accountant.”
OPTION-4: “Malarkey! Why don’t you just dress like everyone else?” chimes your gardener through the window, watering the flowers on your desk along with everything and everyone in the room. “It’ll cost the taxpayer less, you’ll be more relatable, <i>and</i> you won’t need to fuss about all that fancy-schmancy stuff! Heck, why not encourage all government officials to wear clothes that are affordable to the average Quebecan!”
