TEXT:In response to an increasing number of people falling into debt and declaring bankruptcy, activists are arguing that the government should take a stronger role in protecting its citizens from loosely regulated lending firms and in helping its citizens pay off or cancel their debts. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: Palutena Laine, head of consumer watchdog ‘Debt-Busters’ urges the government to enact new laws: “We’ve got middle and lower class families falling victim to predatory financial institutions and plunging into debts they can never hope to repay. The government must pass legislation restricting things like interest rates to stem the tide of people losing their property to these sharks, and take an active role reviewing all loan repayment terms.”
OPTION-1: “That’s just not going far enough!” cries welfare advocate Winchester Ruff. “The government must eliminate the shackles of debt from our good nation once and for all! What we need are vast reforms of the welfare system then we can provide these poor, downtrodden souls with money and housing, so they don’t need to take out such huge loans in the first place!”
OPTION-2: “They’re irresponsible with their money and yet they’re the victims? Call me crazy but borrowing money and not paying it back isn’t debt, it’s theft!” scoffs Cinna Aran, representative of one of the largest lending firms in Mac Mand Min. “What we really need is the power to send these parasites to debtor prisons, where they can work off the money they owe through hard manual labour.”
