What was supposed to be a celebratory occasion — the addition of a flawless (and enormous) new diamond to the Chavoldosperbienian National Museum — has instead turned into a national embarrassment. Independent experts have released a statement declaring the stone to be lab-created, casting doubt on whether the valuable display should be considered a ‘real’ gemstone.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “This isn’t my fault!” trembles gem curator Dmitri McGuffin, responsible for approving the enormously expensive purchase. “The dealer assured us it was a real diamond! An opportunity like that only comes around once in a blue moon, so we <i>had</i> to jump on it! There needs to be a law about this; imitation wares must be clearly labeled as knock-offs, going so far as to arrest dishonest sellers!”
OPTION-2: “That doesnt go far enough!” roars Division of Mining chair Kanya Stephenson, waving this months production reports wildly. “Workers buying luxury goods, at low prices no less? These products are terrible for the moral and economic future of Chavoldosperbien —in fact, this has the making of a bourgeois uprising! What will happen to our production rates when every John and Jane thinks they have risen above their fellow workers? Lab-created diamonds, along with all knock-off goods, must be banned!”
OPTION-3: “These gems really are fascinating,” muses gemologist Oliver Brown, examining a lab-created stone through a microscope. “The only difference between lab stones and the real thing is how these scientific marvels lack all of nature’s flaws. To heck with pulling up rocks from the ground; we should dominate the international market by churning these out in the lab! Think of the boon to our economy when other nations see the quality of the stones were ‘mining’ here! No need to tell them the real source, of course.”
OPTION-4: “This obsession with extravagance is unhealthy,” admonishes noted ascetic Theresa Hawke. “Fake? Real? Why does it matter in the end? We must look to the soul of Chavoldosperbien, and pull back from this worship at the altar of luxury. Renounce riches, renounce commercialism, and encourage the people to do the same. Only in this way shall we reach enlightenment.”
