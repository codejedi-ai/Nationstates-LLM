TEXT:
Dorothy Terwilliger lies immobilized in a hospital bed, unable to move. She has end-stage cancer, and wishes to end her struggle against death. However, laws prevent her doctors from obeying her wishes.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: Dorothy and her family are campaigning for a “Dying with Dignity” bill, to change this situation. She implores the government to legalize euthanasia.
OPTION-1: “I understand this is a very difficult time for these people,” says freelance medical writer Iago Peters. “But the solution is not to let our medical system slide down the slippery slope of killing people in pain. We must cure, not kill. This is not the right time for euthanasia.”
OPTION-2: “I agree, but go further: there is never a right time for euthanasia,” says Bishop Michonne Webster. “The lives we lead are given to us by the grace of God, and he decides when they end. It is not for us to question God’s divine purpose, no matter how odd or screwed-up it may seem.”
