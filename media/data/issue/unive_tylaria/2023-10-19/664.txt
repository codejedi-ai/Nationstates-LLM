TEXT:A large aluminium deposit has been found at Tuna Hills, a remote area in Unive Tylaria. The Environmental Agency is being unusually easy-going, citing minimal potential ecological impact and approving mining to go ahead. Only one obstacle exists - the deposit is right in the middle of a sacred area of the indigenous Pangaoaoangan tribe. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Did you know that aluminium is the second most commonly used metal in our economy?” quizzes aluminium aficionado and bauxite buff Karsang Skinner, pointing to an ‘Ask Me About Electrolysis’ pin-badge proudly displayed on an ironed lapel. “This high quality deposit is a gold mine! Not literally of course, I’m just funning with you. We’re talking minimal tailings, starting at just minus 100 metres! Isn’t that exciting? Oh my goodness, there’s so much we can do when we have aluminium! Why hesitate?”
OPTION-1: “Leader, you must see it from our side,” insists Patty Bonaparte, a tribal elder wearing a sharp business suit and a worker’s hard hat. “Pullabooka - or as you call it - the Tuna Hills, belongs to my people. You cut into it, and you’re not just profaning a holy site, you’re cutting us out of your society! Look, we’re not blind to your economic needs: if you want to mine your metal, why not start seventy miles to the north instead, across that river canyon, then tunnel your way across to the deep deposits? A thousand generations of my ancestors are watching you, Leader. Do the right thing!”
OPTION-2: “That sounds kind of expensive... bit of a dealbreaker if we can’t turn a profit,” muses Xanatos Haaland, a spokesperson from Unive Tylaria City Mining Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility arm. “Look, we don’t need to convince ALL the locals. Let’s just convince the tribal council. They get a healthy inducement fee, say half from you and half from our company, and they can sign whatever papers we need to cover us from future legal challenges. I think, after all, money talks!”
