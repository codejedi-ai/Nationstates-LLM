TEXT:Wild mushroom season is upon Isles of Codist GPTesta again, and as is traditional, Darcys from all over the country will go out to gather nature’s bounty. In recent years, however, there have been more and more deaths due to people mistaking poisonous fungi for harmless ones. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Ignorance is the problem,” comments Mario Morchella, famed plumber and forest forager, passing you a peach he found near an old castle. “You should set up a system for training and licensing people who want to collect wild fungi, require collectors have the best field guide books, and ban any unlicensed individuals from mushroom gathering. Also, increase the number of park rangers, so these life-saving measures are properly enforced.”
OPTION-1: “Quality is the problem,” suggests Harun Cantharellus, one of Isles of Codist GPTesta’s leading mycologists. “First, let’s ban wild mushroom foraging. But also, we must increase funding for mushroom farming research. I know we can develop domesticated mushroom varieties and farming methods that would match wild ones for variation in type, good taste, and other desired properties. People can have their mushrooms and eat them without risking death too!”
OPTION-2: “Greed is the problem,” complains Matilda Grifola, Under-Minister for Food Production. “They’re The People’s mushrooms. They should only be harvested by state agents, after which they can be checked by proper experts and then distributed fairly... with priority rationing for senior Party members, of course.”
OPTION-4: “Mollycoddling is the problem,” grumbles libertarian thinker Solya Amanita. “You should do away with this nanny-state system, and let people take whatever risks they think they can manage; and if they fail well, then that’s just Darwinism at work.”
