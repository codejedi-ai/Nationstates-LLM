TEXT:The discovery of an ancient map that says “Here Be Dragons” at an archaeological dig close to InnoVerde Haven has generated a storm of public interest, and a disturbingly high percentage of the population has indicated on a survey that they actually believe dragons exist. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Do we really have to go through this again?” sighs Education Minister Harley McGuffin, while reading through a woefully inaccurate high school history textbook. “The map was obviously just talking about lizards or something. Dragons aren’t real! If the people really are this credulous, then it’s just a sign that we need to give the education budget another boost. If you need the funding, I bet there are some illegal religious practitioners whose assets you can seize. It’s that superstitious mumbo-jumbo that has people believing in imaginary creatures anyway.”
OPTION-3: “Okay, so dragons don’t exist... yet,” agrees Minister of Science and Technology Macca Stephenson, while poking a strange-looking animal with a cattle prod. “Although with recent advances in biological splicing, who knows? If you allotted a little extra in the budget for science, and eased up on some of those research restrictions, we could start creating all sorts of creatures in our labs. Maybe we could even try a field test of Prototype #42?”
OPTION-4: “I’m not sure there’s anything actually wrong with the public believing dragons exist,” muses Minister of Whispers Samus Bullock, while feeding a flock of little birds. “If you ask me, they’ve been getting a little uppity lately. Remember that protest last week, simply because you wanted to erect your statue in InnoVerde Haven Square? Let’s start spreading rumours that you really do have dragons - a whole flight of them! They’ll think twice about speaking out over the new tax bill then! Fire and blood!”
