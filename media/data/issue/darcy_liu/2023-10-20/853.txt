TEXT:During your trip to see the premiere of your sister’s documentary on the Maxtopian Civil War, your viewing of the film was interrupted by glowing phone screens and obnoxious calls. As it turns out, other citizens often cite this as their biggest pet peeve. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Cinema is an art that requires the viewers’ silence,” begins pretentious movie critic Sejong Trevelyan as he uses his fingers to frame the composition of you at your desk. “If so much as one selfish person draws forth one of those devilish glowing rectangles, the audience as a whole breaks its suspension of disbelief! And, well, it’s rude. I say we ban these devices in movie theaters. Kick the violators out for a start, and maybe fine them for a civil disturbance to get the message across.”
OPTION-1: “Why stop at movie theaters?” asks local snob Amos Clark, well known for hosting extravagant parties. “There’s other places where cell phone usage is annoying or rude. In the courthouse, at school, during speeches, or when I’m trying to host a fancy dinner. In fact, Isles of Codist GPTesta ought to have a lesson in good manners. Force all citizens to undergo mandatory etiquette training and teach respectable cell phone usage in schools. Perhaps then we won’t rank just below those boorish Tasmanians in <i>World Travel Magazine</i>.”
OPTION-2: “What is with all of you?” questions local teenager and film buff Ella Janeway. “Screens can’t possibly be that disruptive. You do know you can adjust the screen brightness on phones, right? Just, like, let people do what they want in the theater. In fact, maybe you should invest in infrastructure so we have better reception all over Isles of Codist GPTesta.”
