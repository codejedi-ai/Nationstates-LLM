TEXT:Trampoline parks are springing up all over Ataidoisesta, with legions of playful children of all ages leaping off raised platforms and bouncing off mats. Perhaps predictably, large numbers of injuries are occurring with a multitude of sprained ankles, a not insignificant number of broken limbs, and even a bizarre incident where two amorous braces-wearing teenagers became entangled and required urgent medical intervention. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “One person per trampoline, no talking while jumping, land only on your feet, do not jump between trampolines, wall trampolines are for decorative purposes only, and the company is not liable for any injuries,” recites Nyota Robinson, CEO of Twist-and-Scream Jump Park. “That’s what it says in our three minute mandatory induction video, and on the waivers that we make all customers sign, and on the big signs above the steel-spiked climbing wall. We don’t need a nanny state telling people what they can and can’t do, and if people hurt themselves then it’s due to their own carelessness. Trampolining is actually great exercise for kids. In fact, you should subsidise schools who want to incorporate our play parks into their school PE lessons. It’ll be fun and educational! Er... funducational!”
OPTION-1: “Nobody is trying to stop kids having fun,” snaps sour-faced parent Wangdi Democratic, pinning his four-year-old son’s arms down to stop him touching a nearby balloon. “There just ought to be more stringent regulations of these businesses, and no legal weight to waiving responsibility for children under their care with a disclaimer. Fine them for each injury that occurs under their watch, and our children will be safer.”
OPTION-2: “Actually, stopping kids having fun sounds like quite a good idea,” observes algebra teacher Newt Onslaugh, decorating a pile of <i>x</i> hundred-question mathematics test papers with a total of (sin<sup>2</sup>(<i>x</i>) + cos<sup>2</sup>(<i>x</i>))(e<sup>2ln10</sup>)<i>x</i> red crosses. “Maybe if the government banned trampoline parks and replaced them with mathematics activity centres then these idiot children might be able to raise their academic achievement levels a little.”
