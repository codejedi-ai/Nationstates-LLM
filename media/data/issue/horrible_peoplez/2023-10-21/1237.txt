TEXT:
An anonymous caller recently asked the police to break up a party at The Ravadow City Beach, citing an ancient law that states: ‘<i>Goers unto the coast must be accompanied by an ursine beast of white fur</i>’. This antiquated statute, leftover from long ago, after an influential courtier had trouble selling two dozen imported polar bears, was never rescinded. A re-examination of the many frivolous and archaic laws that are hidden within the nation’s legislative archives has found its way to you.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “This is a stupid law!” complains Cillian Edwards, who was interrogated by the police during the incident. “I was questioned for half an hour because I didn’t have a polar bear! Where am I supposed to find a polar bear? I’ve done some reading up on these old laws: did you know that in the district of West DataBase it’s illegal for ladies to go out on Saturdays with a non-matching watch and handbag? These laws are foolish, and you should get rid of them.”
OPTION-1: “You can’t be serious!” exclaims Coraline Longstaff, your secretary, who’s wearing goggles because she is within 50 cubits of a fire hose, a law that applies only to the inside of Parliament. “We can’t go around erasing all these half-witted laws — that would be way too much administrative work! We should just issue guidelines to our police officers, advising them to use their discretion about whether to enforce these laws.”
OPTION-2: “Excuse me, but you seem to be forgetting that these people broke the law,” reminds goggleless Chief of Police Michelangelo Shongwe, taking care to stand 51 cubits from the fire hose. “I don’t care how ‘stupid’ you think it is: the fact of the matter is that these people disobeyed the law! Sentence them as they would have been punished when these laws were written!”
