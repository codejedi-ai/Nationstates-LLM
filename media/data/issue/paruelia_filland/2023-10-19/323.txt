TEXT:After the abduction of a young blond girl made national headlines in Paruelia Filland, the concerned parenting organization Mothers Against Youth Doing Stupid Stuff (MAYDSS) has raised concerns over the use of social networking sites by the nation’s teens. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Teens should not be allowed to use social networking!” cries the girl’s mother, Jenna Wright. “Some creep added my little darling as a ‘friend’ on that awful website, and he used it to get all of her personal information and track her down! Obviously, the only sane course of action is to ban all legal minors from using social networking sites! And don’t just stop at social networks: block everything else that MAYDSS doesn’t approve of!”
OPTION-1: “Why that’s utterly preposterous!” shouts Marcus Sugarmountain, founder of MyFace, a popular social networking site. “You can’t restrict people like that! Oh, sure, today it’s keeping teens from lining my wa- I mean - accessing my website, but tomorrow it’s keeping everyone from anywhere the government doesn’t like! I say free up the web, and get rid of restrictions!”
OPTION-2: “You know, there’s always a compromise,” says local birdwatcher Anselm Duterte peering at you from a nearby tree. “As I see it, the best way to keep both sides of the argument happy is to remove all restrictions on what adults can view and increase restrictions on minors. But at the same time, lower the age of majority by a lot. What could possibly go wrong?”
OPTION-3: “What could possibly go wrong, you ask?” panics your paranoid cousin, Frank Lobachevsky. “On the internet, nobody knows your actual age. It’s a haven for malicious anonymity! Besides, children aren’t the only people at risk on the internet. It’s full of stalker-rapists and bomb-makers and viruses and sick, depraved porn. We’re better off without it.”
