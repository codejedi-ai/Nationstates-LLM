TEXT:The National Office of Predictive Crime Patterns (Pre-Crime, for short) has been running analyses of murder, theft and other serious crimes in Paruelia Filland, and has compiled a report noting that certain demographic groups - most notably young Bigtopian men - are up to twenty times more likely to commit crimes than the national average. As your security staff caught a Bigtopian intern trying to set fire to the report in your wastepaper basket, it may perhaps be time for action. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is about efficient policing and prevention over punishment,” suggests slick-suited Pre-Crime Operations Chief Tanya Targaryen, glancing at you suspiciously as she looks up from a print-out of your family tree. “Let’s focus existing surveillance resources on high-risk communities, maybe perform the odd stop-and-search, and carry out the occasional preventative intervention. I can guarantee you lower crime rates with no increase in police spending. That’s a good deal, and my analysts say you are 93.54% likely to take us up on it.”
OPTION-1: “That is the voice of unfounded institutional racism,” says Bigtopian ex-gang member turned youth outreach worker Blake Chandra, waving a ball point pen at you in what seems to be an overly threatening manner. “Human beings are equal, and all should be treated equally by the law, with no individual or group singled out by the state. Why should we face police oppression just because of your prejudices?”
OPTION-2: “In my opinion, Paruelia Filland is under siege from ne’er-do-wells, and in a siege situation extreme measures are needed,” offers respected headmistress Athena McGonegirl. “These Slyth... er... I mean Bigtopians have proven themselves to be untrustworthy. We should make sure that they keep to their areas of Paruelia Fillandian towns and cities, and only allow them back into civilised society after appropriate screening.”
