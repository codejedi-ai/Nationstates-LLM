TEXT:A group of distraught high school girls has brought the problem of stray dogs and cats around Alle Lepubaria to your attention. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “There are too many strays just wandering around!” screams a concerned high school student as she feeds leftover scraps to a noticeably spooked mutt. “We need to gather all these poor animals and get them into a nice shelter where a loving family can adopt them and take care of them - whether they want them or not.”
OPTION-1: “No! No more animals, please!” begs animal shelter director Malon Rubin as she struggles to latch a cage full of cats. “Look, I love these fluffballs as much as the next guy, but we just can’t handle any more. We’re up to our ears in animals! The problem isn’t with the strays, it’s with irresponsible pet owners not spaying and neutering their pets. It’s high time we required everyone to fix their pets. Do that and this problem will disappear.”
OPTION-2: “These animals deserve to be free!” screeches Hillary Amin, a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Everything. “They found a home in the back alleyways and dumps. Who are you to take them away from their homes, tame them and make them your slaves? They don’t exist for your entertainment. We must free all of the animals!”
OPTION-3: “Let’s not get hasty here,” interrupts Major Burns while polishing his oak leaves and war medals. “Now these animals could be of use to the police here and overseas with our brave soldiers. There are plenty of jobs that simply aren’t suited to our patriotic boys in uniform. Yes, plenty of dangerous jobs. It’s not like these strays are going to be missed. And at least we’d be giving them hot meals and a dignified purpose!”
OPTION-4: “One bullet each should do the trick,” bluntly states a mustachioed local-government employee while loading a revolver. “Problem solved.”
