TEXT:When a senior government official was caught on camera groping an intern, your press liaison downplayed the incident by calling it an “alternative handshake” at a subsequent press conference. While the case in question was settled swiftly and discreetly, members of the professional commentariat are engaging in a loud brawl over the government’s flexible approach to facts. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is dangerous,” argues Kimberly Drinkwater, a journalist at <i>The Alle Lepubaria City Post</i>, struggling to cope with mixed feelings of moral outrage and giddy excitement. “Granted, politics has always been about playing the facts a bit, but now you’re not even trying to hide it. This deliberate distortion of truth is corrupting public discourse, and will surely undermine the very foundation of our society if not kept in check. Government must be bound by law to always speak the truth, and you should set up an independent public body tasked with enforcing the standards we deserve.”
OPTION-1: “Typical slave morality,” sniggers Pietro Levy, dropout philosophy student and manager of operations at an alt-nazi meme factory. “Instead of mindlessly enforcing the ‘truth’ of weaklings and half-men, this is a perfect opportunity for an overhaul and bringing about the complete transvaluation of all values. The elevation of feebleness has been going on for too long; it’s about time you started making and enforcing your own truths!”
OPTION-2: “The notion of any ‘one’ truth is inherently oppressive,” states Jean-Paul Leotard, a postmodernist literary critic, mostly known for his colorful scarves. “Fact is, there are only our own personal interpretations, and the world is really only the resulting diversity of particular truths. You shouldn’t get to say what’s right or wrong! There’s your policy, Leader: quit shoving ‘objective’ dogma down our throats and let everyone believe what they want about stuff.”
