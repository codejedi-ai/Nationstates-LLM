TEXT:Bigtopian activists have staged a sit-in at the largest primary school in Alle Lepubaria bringing education to a halt in a bid for integration and tolerance. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “You know... it’s not that we don’t let them in... it’s that they don’t apply,” murmurs Principal Shigeru al-Zahawi, coughing nervously. “I mean, yeah, sure, if these Bigtopians lived around here... uh... we’d let them into the school. But... you know... this isn’t exactly a Bigtopian community, you know? So... uh... could you please put a stop to these protestors? Oh, and, uh...” Here he leans forward and whispers. “... make sure those creepy Bigtopian protestors don’t show up at my school again, okay?”
OPTION-1: “The time has come for the dream of equality to be realized!” shouts noted Bigtopian rights activist Stefanie Franco, slamming a fist against your desk. “I see Lilliputians, Tasmanians, and Lord knows how many East Lebatuckese keeping my Bigtopian brothers holed away in their prisons of blindness and ethnic apartheid! The time has come for full integration! If these schools are going to keep us out, I say it’s time we were bussed in!”
OPTION-2: “Well, that’s all well and good, but it ain’t well and good enough!” screams Barbara McCartney, leader of Bigtopians Rising Against Totalitarianist Scum, slamming a black-gloved fist against the podium during a recent pep rally. “We ain’t just bein’ kept out of their schools; we’re bein’ kept out of their neighborhoods! The oppressive majority fears us, but they can’t hold us back any longer! The government needs to integrate the community as a whole by pushing out the majority and making way for a very loud, very angry minority!”
