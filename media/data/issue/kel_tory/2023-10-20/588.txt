TEXT:The Kel Tory City Police Department has reported an upsurge in alcohol-related crime in recent weeks, with bar-fights, vandalism, and street violence all on the rise. Now, with a drunken city councilor involved in a street brawl with an equally drunk Brancalandian ambassador, it is perhaps time for you to intervene in the embarrassing levels of booze-fueled mayhem. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “These pubs are cesspools of crime and delinquency!” rages Temperance League founder and avowed pacifist Noah Murdoch, throwing a bottle full of perfectly good beer on the floor, smashing it. “And don’t forget the broken families and long-term health problems associated with drinking yourself to death! The government must ban all alcoholic drinks and shut down every last bar in Kel Tory in order to safeguard public safety.”
OPTION-1: “Maybe just a selective ban? After all, beer doesn’t get you drunk nearly as quickly as whiskey or vodka,” proposes Tamara Thawne, who has the difficult job of cleaning up all the messes in the Surly Wench Pub. “Just set an upper limit of 6% ABV. That way people still have a way to blow off steam, but they’ll be a little less likely to smash bottles or brawl over the Strandbeastball game.”
OPTION-2: “I can do... what I want... with my body,” staggers Björk Chekov, who is already drunk at 10 in the morning. “The government should just get off my... back.” The sot abruptly falls down.
