TEXT:Due to desertification, the transition of habitable land to desert as a result of overcultivation and the increasing degradation of the environment, much of Yes Enes’s once-green rural areas are turning into barren, rocky deserts. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is a disaster,” wails Stanislawa Bottomley, your Minister of the Environment. “We’ve been too lax on letting the agriculture sector overgraze and overcrop our lands and now we’re paying the price. There needs to be some serious cutback on what farmers are allowed to do, or before you know it we’re going to be scaling sand dunes on the way to work.”
OPTION-1: “‘Ey there, you stupid townie, what about us?” shouts Farmer’s Union Leader Bajrakitiyabha Hammarskjöld, waving a pitchfork from atop a combine harvester parked outside. “We’s just goin’ t’ be tole we’re out of a job? Tha’ best way t’ goes about this is t’ promote stuff like that there recyclin’, crop rotatin’, an’ biodiversity, and t’ gives us tha’ subsidies we needs t’ work in ‘armony wi’ mother nature. Desertification ain’t no irreversible thing, an’ claimin’ tha’ land back will be slow and bloody expensive, by thunder. But oi’m sure tha’ taxpayers will be more than ‘appy t’ aid us ‘umble farmers in our plight, and maybe gives us a little more say in things in future, so’s this can’t ‘appen again.”
OPTION-2: “Yee-haw, these here deserts are the greatest thang that’s happened in YARS!” drawls noted cowboy Hamish McGraw, twirling his shootin’ irons. “This is just what Yes Enes needs! Just git a stagecoach out har an tha’ foreign types will come a-flockin,’ y’all see if ah’m wrong! We don’t need no fundin’ f’ tha’ environment! Them’s farmers c’n jus’ git minin’ fer GOLD!”
