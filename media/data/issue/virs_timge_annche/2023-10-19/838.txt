TEXT:The beloved comic book series <i>Dogman</i> is set to mark its eightieth anniversary this year. A coalition of comic book aficionados, young and old, have gathered outside your office to decide how to best celebrate this achievement. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “You know what I loved?” reminisces ageing general Erica al-Assad. “The war arc! Ha ha! Great fun to see Dogman giving those blighters from Blackacre what-for! That’s the kind of patriotic hero our country should be celebrating. Make Dogman a symbol of patriotism and Virs Timge Annchean supremacy, an icon of our strength! Our enemies will learn to truly fear our bark and our bite.”
OPTION-1: “You know, Dogman stands for a lot more than just beating up bad guys,” counters Karl Foster, a well-known environmentalist and peace activist. “He shows children how important it is to take care of nature, and how kindness is the greatest superpower of all. Dogman-themed recycling bins and a positive ad campaign could be a great hit and really send out the right message.”
OPTION-2: “Dogman is all very well, and a good role model for boys, but what about the girls?” asks renowned newspaper columnist Paris May. “Why don’t we use this to celebrate some of the famous women in the comics? After all, Dogmans long-term love interest donned the mantle of Weasel Lady for four whole issues whilst Dogman was in hospital after his battle with Irritant Flower.”
OPTION-3: “Hah! That run of comics was so full of inconsistencies it would be funny if it werent so tragic,” sneers comic book enthusiast and self-proclaimed expert on Dogman, Wolfgang Solo. “Quite apart from anything else, The Bamboozler’s machine was destroyed in issue 242, yet somehow he manages to bring it back to mortally wound Dogman in a later issue. And a normal human that is somehow able to don the sacred Weasel Lady mantle? Worst storyline ever! Lets at least make this celebration somewhat balanced. I have a long list here of the various inconsistencies in the series for your speech...”
OPTION-4: “You know these comics are bull, right?” says Jamie Logan, former vigilante and one of six men who has fought crime on the streets under the mantle of Dogman in the past century. “Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this. In the real world, people die, and no dude in a leotard can stop that. Adults shouldn’t read superhero comics. Force them to grow up, and drag them back to face reality.” He stares moodily at the cloudy sky, waiting for the Dogsignal.
