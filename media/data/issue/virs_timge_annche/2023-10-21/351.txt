After a highly publicized arrest, in which one of the nation’s wealthiest celebrities was detained for assaulting two of her servants with a priceless Fabergé egg, some of Virs Timge Annche’s rich have begun demanding the right to avoid prison terms by paying off their victims.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “It makes, like, no sense for someone like ME to be stuck here for three WHOLE DAYS,” whines Clarrisse Milton during a jail cell interview, only after dimming the lights and getting earplugs for her hangover. “And the trial hasn’t even STARTED. My daddy has PLENTY of money and, like, nothing better to spend it on. He could just give a few million 💰 💰s to the victims’ families and, um... like, the government. That’s fair, right?”
OPTION-1: “You’ve got to be kidding me!” bellows Virs Timge Annche’s Attorney General, Enrique James, angrily pounding his fist on your desk. “No one should be above the law, no matter how much money they have! It’s bad enough that they can hire some shyster lawyer to get them off on a technicality most of the time. As a matter of fact, we should make the rich use public defenders. It’s only fair considering everyone else is stuck with them. You know what, just expand the entire public defenders’ office while you’re at it.”
OPTION-2: “Instead of wasting money on prisons for violent criminals, I could take care of your problem,” suggests Samuel Prefect, Virs Timge Annche’s wealthiest psychopath, while polishing a rifle. “I’m an unrivaled hunter, but with animals there’s no challenge for an expert such as myself. If you sent prey to my island estate, I’d be willing to throw a few 💰 💰s the government’s way. You save money; I take care of the scum in your penal system. Sounds like a win-win to me.”
