TEXT:Fox Pharmaceuticals, a major international drug company based in TechnoLiberia, was recently linked to illegal human experimentation and an organ harvesting cult in the underdeveloped, jungle nation of Kawandaland. Its atrocities exposed, the company has gone bottom-up, throwing TechnoLiberian markets into turmoil, and largely eliminating access to inexpensive medical supplies in Kawandaland. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Fox Pharmaceuticals was both dealing diphenhydramine and defiling human rights,” states Stanislav Shufflebottom, the TechnoLiberian ambassador to Kawandaland. “While they should have stayed with the former, we cannot allow this to cause a fatal reaction as far as TechnoLiberian-Kawandalandian relations are concerned. Let’s begin medical aid shipments to their country. While it might not be cheap, such an action may yet preserve our honor in the eyes of these noble people.”
OPTION-1: “Oh, I’d love to bandage up Kawandaland too, ambassador,” chimes in Atlas Berenstein, a top-level official in the Finance Ministry. “You do realize that our economy is being wounded by this catastrophe as well, right? I agree that the situation in Kawandaland is a sad one, but we must save ourselves while we still have the chance. Instead of spending millions of francs on medical aid, we should use those funds to stabilize our markets. It might seem cold and heartless, but I’m just following triage procedures, and I believe the bleeding is worse here in TechnoLiberia.”
OPTION-2: “The actions of my former employers are quite repulsive, and have left quite a mess,” admits Faith Grossweiner, a former representative of Fox Pharmaceuticals. “Do not despair for I have a fast-acting, extra-strength, non-drowsy method to resolve this! If the government could nationalize the pharmaceutical industry, then it’s only a matter of time before the markets rally back and we can eventually shift our interest back towards Kawandaland.”
