TEXT:Through a complex and unorthodox set of theological deductions, respected community faith leader Justin Keating decided that the local cryonics facility was a work of intrinsic evil. Late one night, he broke in and took a sledge hammer to ten cryogenically frozen brains. He didn’t try to evade or resist arrest, and is now honestly surprised people think he has done anything wrong. The question is, what exactly is his crime? 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Those who had their brains frozen were working on the assumption that they might one day in the future be resurrected, something which experts say is a virtual statistical certainty, given enough time,” explains cryonics facility director Debra Rhee, whose ruthless business dealings have earned her the nickname ‘Captain Cold’. “Now, they’ve been denied that. That makes this crime ten counts of murder. Hopefully, nice strict sentencing here will teach people not to mess with our corporate holdings in the future.”
OPTION-1: “Whoa, whoa! Playing piñata with some dead frozen brain popsicles is not the same as spilling the sloppy red stuff of a living person!” asserts tactless journalist Elsa Yossef. “I’m not saying we should just let it go, but this wasn’t murder. It was a crime of forced entry, damage to corporate property and desecration of human remains. Perhaps we should exercise some leniency seeing how this was, in fact, a political protest.”
OPTION-2: “Actually... there may have been a solid basis for what this protester was saying,” ponders theologian Jadis Queen, poring over some apocryphal texts of her faith. “To be on the safe side, we should shut down all cryonics facilities. After all, our immortal souls may be at risk here.”
OPTION-3: “Not sure if this is a criminal matter or just some religious lunatic with a hammer,” comments pizza delivery boy Gawain Fry, handing you your pizza. “The guy was clearly nuts either way. Sounds to me like a mental health problem. He needs a psychiatrist, not a prison cell.”
