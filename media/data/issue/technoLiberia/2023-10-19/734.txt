TEXT:With its colorful packaging and pleasantly sweet aroma, <i>Health-Squirt Vitamin Juice</i> has rapidly become one of the most popular drink products in TechnoLiberia. Helping its sales are prime-time TV adverts claiming that it is<i> “a superfood that puts immune system boosting natural detox elements and energy-enhancing anti-oxidant vitamins into your cardiovascular system”</i>. It was recently discovered that the product has no such qualities, and the adverts are clearly lying. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “False Advertising, Nuisance To Public!” proclaims Hosea Cesternino, lead journalist for <i>Health Magazine</i>, clearly planning his next newspaper headline. “But will it ever go away? In this journo’s humble opinion, yes! Maybe the government should review advertisements to make sure we get THE TRUTH!”
OPTION-1: “Or you could relax on our beautiful lounge chairs on our charming private beach,” suggests marketing rep Mia Hudson, offering you an ice-cool bottle of <i>Health-Squirt</i>, now with <i>Sports Slurp Technology<sup>TM</sup></i>. “It’s not like we’re doing any harm, and promoting the idea of health has got to be of some benefit to those zombified couch potatoes who sit and play <i>Foxes vs Skeletons</i> all day. We didn’t really do anything wrong, right? Don’t treat people like idiots who don’t know what they’re buying. Treat them like idiots who keep the consumer economy going! Deregulate advertising, and the free market will create wealth for TechnoLiberia.”
OPTION-2: A tired-looking and shaggy-haired fellow plops down into your comfiest chair. “You know what, Leader? I have had enough of ads. They interrupt my television watching, and we’re basically immune to them anyway.” He sips his Eckie-Cola and adjusts his designer sweatband. “I say we ban all TV advertisements between midday and midnight so we can watch the good stuff on the telly uninterrupted. Now, can I go back to watching my soap opera?”
