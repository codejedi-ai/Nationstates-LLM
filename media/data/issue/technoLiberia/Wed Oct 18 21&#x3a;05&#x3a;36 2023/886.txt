TEXT:Popular TV show <i>Fox the Bounty Hunter</i> was recently canceled after the eponymous fugitive-finder accidentally shot and killed three innocent bystanders. Now, the legality of the profession of bounty hunting is being called into question. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Those bounty hunters ain’t nothin’ but trouble, creating a grand ol’ fuss wherever they go,” drawls Sheriff Alice Longbottom, while holstering her six-shooter. “I reckon bounty huntin’ ought not be allowed. Us lawmen can deal with outlaws just fine ourselves! Problem is, ma deputies are busier than a centipede at a leg-countin’ contest. We need to up our police spendin’ somethin’ fierce, then we’ll have these criminals whupped soon enough.”
OPTION-1: “Cops are too concerned with the ‘order’ part of law and order,” states the leather-clad, heavily-tattooed bounty hunter. “We hunters can get the job done, and if we don’t, you don’t have to pay us. While cops are too busy scarfing down doughnuts and taking ‘sensitivity training’ to catch the bad guys, we’re out in the real world, on the trail of the outlaws. Slash your police force and put bounties on the heads of all criminals. You can bet our kind will have the streets of TechnoLiberia free of scum by the end of the month, or my name ain’t ‘Fox’.”
OPTION-2: “This whole incident just illustrates the dangers of trying to chase criminals,” declares a random citizen, remarkable only for his thick glasses, large nose, and bushy mustache. “If criminals run away from law enforcement, that should be the end of it; chasing them is simply too risky. I’m sure those coppers will have another chance to catch me - I mean - <i>those criminals</i>.”
