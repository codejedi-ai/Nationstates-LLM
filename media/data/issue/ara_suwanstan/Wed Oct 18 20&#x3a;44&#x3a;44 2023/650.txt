TEXT:Hacktivist group <i>KwikiLeaks</i> revealed the existence of the so-called <i>Trolls From Cooperate Ziggurat</i>, a government-sponsored organization designed to spread pro-Ara Suwanstan propaganda throughout the internet. The group has recently been caught instigating a separatist movement in Brancaland, and you’ve personally been made aware that they were responsible for unleashing the dreaded DEAT virus in Marche Noire. Concerned “netizens” are asking you whether this group is acting beyond its mandate. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “We should be giving these heroes a medal, not condemning them!” exclaims your paranoid Propaganda Minister while checking the room for bugs. “It’s obvious that Marche Noire and Brancaland were plotting attacks! Why else would Brancaland be hiking maple syrup prices? What we need is more funding and manpower to continue the fine work of my ministry. With a few keystrokes and the click of a mouse, we can destabilize our enemies... or at least distract them from more pressing matters!”
OPTION-1: “Spreading propaganda was one thing, attacks on sovereign nations is another,” rebuffs Barry Ramirez, the Brancalandian Ambassador, seen dressed in the traditional Brancalandian parka. “Thanks to these Ara Suwanstanian sponsored cyber-terrorists, the province of Quaybeck is launching a violent separatist movement! These hackers are an international menace, and you must do something aboot it! Shut these trolls down and extradite them. Or you’ll be sorry!”
OPTION-2: “Are you going to let these foreigners walk all over us?” asks your Interior Minister, who simply wants this issue to be dealt with before tonight’s episode of <i>CSI: Cooperate Ziggurat</i> airs. “We obviously don’t want to risk our friendship with Brancaland or make things worse with Marche Noire. These brave keyboard warriors just need a little policing. I can rein these groups in and remind them of their original mandate, which is to spread love, not war.”
OPTION-3: “Why not disown this <i>Trolls From Cooperate Ziggurat</i> and state that <i>Kwikileaks</i> is in the pockets of East Lebatuck?” suggests your easily distracted Minister of Technology, while playing <i>Maxémon Woah</i> on her phone. “This gives you more wiggle room to allow these groups to fight it amongst themselves. So what if they end up starting a few international incidents or if those reds in East Lebatuck retaliate? What’s the worst that could happen?”
