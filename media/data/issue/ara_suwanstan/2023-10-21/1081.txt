An undergraduate medical statistician has stumbled across a weird occurrence: three of the five actors involved in a theatrical piece called <i>The Queen in Yellow</i>, as well as over ten percent of the members of the opening night audience, have since received diagnoses of various psychiatric illnesses.

Please accept these free tickets from us devoted fans, then personally endorse this wonderful play.”
