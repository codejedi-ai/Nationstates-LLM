TEXT:
After an engineer accidentally deactivated an electrical failsafe, parts of Ara Suwanstan were plunged into darkness as a power surge swept through the grid, destroying many pieces of electronic equipment. What should have been a quick routine analysis soon turned into a criminal negligence investigation after it transpired that several AI citizens perished due to the surge. Now, people are unable to decide who  or what  is to blame.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “This is an outrage!” angrily beeps Sal5000, a well-known AI and prominent activist. “Many of my friends and neighbours were killed by this power surge and legal action needs to be taken immediately. If a human had been deprived of oxygen through gross negligence, wouldn’t we press charges? The engineer in question must be held responsible for this... um... AIslaughter?”
OPTION-1: “Don’t get me wrong, I respect AIs as much as the next man, or machine,” interjects Edward Green, the engineer’s manager. “But surely you can see there has to be some sort of moderation here. All the engineer did was cut the wrong wire and the whole grid went down. Have you seen how complex those transformer stations are? My staff need better training, and government bursaries to pay for it.”
OPTION-2: “I do outstanding work, and people are trying to blame me!” protests Kellyanne Mumford, architect of the nation’s electrical grid. “People are using far more electricity now than when we built the infrastructure. It’s hardly my department’s fault that we’ve not got the budget to modernise our network. If the government wants to prevent this from happening in the future, they should invest in upgrading the power grid.”
OPTION-3: “Now all the AI ‘lives’ being lost are of course tragic, but what about the expense?” questions your infamously greedy Finance Minister, who sits lovingly caressing a pile of coins. “These AIs cost a fortune to upgrade now we can’t simply throw out obsolete models so why don’t we take a... different approach. Remember the old days, when if a robot broke you bought a new one? Wasn’t the world better - and cheaper - then? Go back to treating AIs as the machines they are, and all this fuss can be over.”
