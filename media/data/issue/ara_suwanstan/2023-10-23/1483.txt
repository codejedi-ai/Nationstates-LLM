Civil rights groups are calling you to action after journalists discovered that an isolated community in Ara Suwanstan has been conducting female genital cutting on at least one girl every week.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-1: “Female circumcision is not harmful,” reads Gillian Yoo of the Tasmanian immigrant community as her husband stands behind her. “We women organize and perform the ritual, having undergone it ourselves, so it’s not anti-woman. It turns a girl into a proper lady  honorable, clean, and chaste. My daughters would be bullied and without husbands if they weren’t cut. It is impossible for you to change our culture. In fact, trying to impose your values on us as if we were infants or savages is racism. Invest more money in our neighborhoods so we can more efficiently and safely conduct even more circumcisions. Mandate that everyone educate themselves about the benefits of this little procedure.”
OPTION-2: “Call it what it is  female genital mutilation!” rages activist Victor Eliot. “These uncivilized, primitive savages are so ignorant! They’re genetically inferior monkeys with low-IQ brains. FGM has zero benefits and leads to so many harmful complications: infections, cysts, urinary problems, fistulae, bleeding, infertility, depression, and problems during pregnancy! That’s just the tip of the iceberg! Make female genital mutilation a crime of the highest order! Police must be allowed to do all they can to prevent and investigate it.”
OPTION-3: “As much as I appreciate and value other cultures, maybe I can draw the line here,” opines woke woman Luna Lovegood. “It’s all well and good if it’s consensual, just like a nose job or breast enhancement, but when it’s done on little girls because your ancestors or your god said so, that’s when I might object! We should make FGM illegal, but let’s not go out of our way to find instances of it happening, as it is a crime that can be easily hidden. Rather, we should spend money on reaching out to these insular communities to educate them and change their attitudes.”
