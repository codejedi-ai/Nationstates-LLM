TEXT:A recent top division women’s football match set the lowest all-time attendance record of just five people. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Women’s football is losing the federation a lot of money,” sighs Darcyusian Football Federation president Seth Blather as he polishes his pricey Spinex watch. “It’s a catch-22. No one wants to watch women’s football because it is lower quality, but we can’t invest in player development without a paying audience. The whole industry will collapse without government funding. We’ll use the money to develop grassroots sport, hire professional managers, and fund executive team incentives every time we meet ambitious targets such as doubling attendance in women’s matches. What were the attendance numbers again?”
OPTION-1: “The government should discourage girls playing boy sports and the other way around!” suggests an acne-ravaged teenager, who has enough oil on his face to justify an invasion from the United Federation. “For example, football and pheonixball are for men while beach volleyball and foxy boxing are for women. After all, nobody’s going to pay to watch tomboys playing a man’s game or some effeminate blokes throwing around a netball like an idiot.”
OPTION-2: “Why don’t we force professional sporting leagues to schedule men’s and women’s doubleheaders for every match?” proposes your Minister of Alternative Solutions, who is scrubbing the office toilet with a sponge attached to a drill after he used your toilet brush as a replacement for a missing door stop. “That way, we’ll fix the attendance problem, men and women can split the revenue equally, and sports fans get double the action! What could go wrong?”
