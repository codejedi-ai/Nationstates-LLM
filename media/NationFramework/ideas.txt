These two philosophies, originating from different corners of the world, offer profound wisdom for leading fulfilling lives and building a thriving society.

**Sisu** - Hailing from the resilient spirit of the Finnish people, "Sisu" embodies perseverance, courage, and an unyielding determination to overcome challenges. It's the relentless pursuit of one's goals and the strength to withstand adversity with unwavering resolve. In our nation, "Sisu" is a driving force, reminding us that no obstacle is insurmountable, and that together, we have the resilience to endure and thrive in the face of adversity.

**Pura Vida** - Originating from the vibrant culture of Costa Rica, "Pura Vida" celebrates life's simplicity, positivity, and the profound joy found in everyday moments. It encourages us to appreciate the beauty of nature, relish genuine connections, and find contentment in the present. In our nation, "Pura Vida" inspires us to embrace life with open hearts, to savor the beauty in our surroundings, and to foster a culture of optimism and well-being.

The fusion of "Sisu" and "Pura Vida" in our national philosophy creates a powerful and balanced approach to life and governance. We draw from "Sisu" to face challenges with tenacity and unwavering determination, while "Pura Vida" encourages us to savor the journey, nurture our well-being, and treasure the harmonious connections that bind us as a society.
