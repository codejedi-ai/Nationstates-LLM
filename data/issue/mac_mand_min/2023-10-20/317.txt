TEXT:Advisers from Mac Mand Min’s security services have created a small piece of spyware that they would like to install on every computer in the nation so they can track activity. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “For the good of all,” claims Department of Protection head Randy Perez. “This tiny little program will simply collect data and send it via the internet to one of our databases. Nobody will even notice that it’s there. Besides, who’s gonna notice a handful of bytes under mountains of stolen MP3s? Just give us the green light and we’ll be rounding up terrorists faster than you can say ‘lolcat’! And, hey, while we’re at it, we could even use it to alert people when there’s danger!”
OPTION-1: “Are you insane?” shouts privacy advocate Yui Weasley. “These are our personal computers; they’re not the government’s property! The last thing we need is the government poking its big, fat nose into our business. Keep the government’s hands off my harddrive! What’s next? Brain implants? Leave my brainwaves alone, you jack-booted thugs!”
OPTION-2: “While ‘tis not my place,” says Amish farmer Bawu de Vil, “I just thought I’d mention that we Amish don’t have any of this so-called ‘cyber-crime’. Aye, ‘tis a boring life, and plowin’ gets old, but abolishing all of those computer-machines would certainly solve thy problems. Perhaps ye should just abandon phones and fax machines, too. Then ye’ll be on your way to livin’ in an Amish paradise!”
