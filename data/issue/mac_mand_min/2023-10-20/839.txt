TEXT:After a recent incident where a lifeguard refused to save a drowning swimmer because she thought he looked like he belonged to another political party, talking heads on cable TV have seized upon the moment to ask if the current partisan political tensions in Mac Mand Min have gotten out of control. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Clearly the root of the problem is the media capitalizing on existing tensions for monetary gain,” argues frequent cable TV pundit Guinan Skinner, unfazed by the chagrined frown of the show’s host. “We need to put rules in place so the media cannot be so blatantly partisan and negative in its reporting of political news stories...”
OPTION-1: “That’s precisely the sort of dangerous idiocy your party would advocate!” shouts host Luis Blofeld, cutting off her attempts to talk. “People just need a little incentive to break through their bubbles and see the other side as people too. Give a small tax break to people based on how many of their MyFace friends have different political views, and I’m sure all this partisan hullabaloo will be gone overnight.”
OPTION-2: As the program quickly cuts to an ad-break, a soothing, over-cheerful voice caresses your ears. “Looking for love, friendship, and happiness?” On screen, a cascade of fizzy Eckie-Ecola is poured into a glass, ice cubes clinking. “Pop the can, and feel all the love you can! Nothing brings you closer together than Eckie-Ecola.”
OPTION-3: “I don’t see what the problem is,” notes your aide, turning off your TV. “In fact, I say we enhance partisan identification by designating what colors people can wear based on their political affiliation. Then you’ll immediately know who is working to better the country, and who only has morally bankrupt and wrongheaded ideas.”
