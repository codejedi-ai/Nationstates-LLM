TEXT:Ubalin, a small city in southwestern Mac Mand Min, was formerly a monarchical city-state before being annexed in the early history of Mac Mand Min. DNA testing on the remains of the last king of Ubalin, King Oswyn V, traced his lineage to a local man in a poor district of Mac Mand Min City. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Momma! Momma! Git the whiskey! No! The gud kind!” shouts Lamar Wolfe, the newly-found heir to the House of Ood. “Well, it’s about time that my royal ‘eritarge is recugnized! I declare myself the absolute ruler of Ubalin as Yer Majesty King Rex! I will be the most high and most excellent king Ubalin has ever had! And as my first act as King, I declare Ubalin’s independence from Mac Mand Min; the Ubalinders will be free and independent again under my rule.” He then turns to your young secretary. “And darling, if you want to be a Queen, just hit me up.”
OPTION-1: “Liberté, égalité, fraternité!” yells Francine Dubois, the current mayor of Ubalin. “We first became a part of this great country as a direct result of when that tyrant Oswyn was violently ripped apart by blackout drunk peasants! To prevent reactionaries from poisoning and breaking apart the nation with outdated traditions, we need to denounce monarchy for the sham it is whenever it pops up!”
OPTION-4: “Maybe there’s a compromise,” speculates Lancelot Lewis, a prolific jouster and part-time mutton farmer. “How about instead of making him the absolute monarch of Ubalin, we install King... Rex as a constitutional monarch of Ubalin. That way Ubalin stays a part of Mac Mand Min and continues to be run by competent politicians, but they’ll have a bit of tradition to rally behind. And imagine having an actual king open the Ubalin medieval fayre. My mutton sales will go through the roof!”
