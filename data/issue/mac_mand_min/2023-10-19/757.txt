TEXT:A series of cases of mistaken identity from the credit bureau Expertfaux recently culminated in your young cousin receiving a deluge of petitions from aggrieved citizens. Frustrated Mac Mand Minians, who are beginning to doubt their own names, have called the efficacy and necessity of modern credit bureaus into question. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “These people have no credibility!” protests Kima Freeman, littering your desk with the shredded ruins of his credit report. “Incompetent credit bureaus’ background checks labeled Mr. McFly as a criminal and Ms. Stark as deceased. Besides, any attempt to boil down my life into a single number will fall short of doing me justice. Credit bureaus need more oversight, so they can’t come between hardworking Mac Mand Minians and the loans we need!”
OPTION-1: “These were minor mishaps,” claims Cristobel Brown, a representative from Expertfaux, who appears to be addressing a government accountant instead of you. “Lenders, landlords, and even employers need our services to weed out undeserving clients. Imagine if companies didn’t know who in the blue they were lending to! Credit bureaus must be allowed to self-regulate without government interference. The future of our wallets depends on it!”
OPTION-2: “Doing background checks one at a time is so inefficient,” muses the accountant in question, Jazz Haskell. “Why not put credit regulation under government control, and research people’s financial history in advance? That way anybody can access our database at any time. I’m sure the police would love to have a record of major transactions and movements too.”
