TEXT:A shocking exposé on tourist attraction OceanWorld has revealed the mistreatment of captive orcas and other marine animals. Your office has since faced a tidal wave of complaints demanding government action. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is torture!” shouts renowned whale biologist Willy Free, seen wearing an orca costume. “These poor and mistreated creatures can’t experience their natural habitat, and frankly live solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short lives! They can handle living in the wilderness and thrive better there. We must end these inhumane captivity programs. The same can go for zoos, circuses, and aquariums, too.”
OPTION-2: “You can’t do that, you ignorant whale lovers!” pleads the Marine Director of OceanWorld, Ásmunda Einstein. “If you ban institutions like OceanWorld, how are endangered species going to survive in this big bad world? Isn’t it better that their populations thrive in our viewing tanks, rather than struggling in prime fishing waters? Besides, your average Darcy will never get the chance to see these animals except at a zoo. Do you want to deny them that experience? Not to mention zoos and conservation programs like ours are a great way to get people interested in the environment. Everyone wins with OceanWorld!”
OPTION-3: “Perhaps there could be a compromise?” queries your Minister of the Environment, Felix Looney, who has been smelling like grass lately. “Ending zoos would harm the tourism industry, and we can’t deny that these programs help endangered species. Why don’t we set a limit on what animals they take? Specifically the endangered ones? I’m sure that we can also force tougher standards to ensure OceanWorld treats the animals humanely as well.”
