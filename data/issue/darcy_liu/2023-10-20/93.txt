TEXT:After minority student Gyunmin Smetana was refused admission to a traditional, prestigious college, civil rights activists, conservatives, and teachers are up in arms about affirmative action and ethnic equality in education. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “I think you’ll find there’s actually no problem here,” observes conservative speaker and hair care product salesperson Yuri Bonaparte. “A student wants to go to a particular school, but lacks the grades. Clearly, he should have studied harder in school. But oh, because he’s a so-called minority, it’s everyone else’s fault. I’m sorry, but the system is working perfectly well: What gets you into a good school is merit alone. Or, failing that, a generous donation.”
OPTION-1: “Are you blind, or do you simply refuse to see?” thunders civil rights activist, former TV commentator and unabashed publicity speaker Crispin Hackett. “Oh yes, it’s all perfectly equal, if we ignore the fact that this poor boy was stacking shelves to pay for textbooks in a falling-down school while the nice rich boys were enjoying private tutoring! Affirmative action is needed to balance out the very real disadvantages that many students grow up with! And there’s no better way to identify that disadvantage than with broad, sweeping demographics!”
OPTION-2: “I think you’re both loony,” says Jaz Nimoy, professor of liberal arts at Isles of Codist GPTesta National University. “In my humble opinion, the solution is simple: make college education free to all. Why turn away anyone? Throw open the gates and make college education available to every citizen of Isles of Codist GPTesta, regardless of their economic status, grades, or work ethic!”
