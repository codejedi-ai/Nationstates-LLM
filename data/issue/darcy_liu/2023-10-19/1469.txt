TEXT:While reporting an incident where no less than seven cats got stuck in the same tree at once, broadcasts on major news networks featured blaring noises and rapidly flashing colors, causing many discomfort, migraines, and in a few cases, full-blown epileptic seizures. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “The last thing I expect in the morning is to be attacked by my television, and there’s no doubt that this stinking migraine I have is from that news report,” sighs beleaguered mum Brenda Williams, whose five-year-old has loudly sung sixty-seven consecutive repetitions of the Baby Shark song since coming into your office. “The jabbering nonsense news anchors regurgitate is painful enough. News and other TV shows must be barred from broadcasting these sorts of noises and graphics.”
OPTION-1: “What if we made shows put epilepsy warnings before each instance and program?” suggests children’s show editor Ken Doolittle, showing you a happy face with a warning in colorful, flashy letters. “Then people will know when to switch channels, and networks will favor writers who are more conscientious. It’s a nice compromise that can be applied to all media. Hey, I know a song about compromise we can all sing! Just to warn you, there’s some moderately loud clapping in the middle.”
OPTION-2: “Why should my show be compromised?” refutes popular TV show host Peggy LeChiffre, entering your office with blinding rainbow strobe lights. “Which would you rather watch? A boring old guy in a suit, or a cinematic extravaganza featuring epic explosions and fast-paced drama? If some people are too sensitive to watch the news, then they can always listen to it on radio or something. You know, you should give your official political broadcasts more pizzaz too. I’ll give you the number of the SFX guys I use. I guarantee people will sit up and take notice!”
