TEXT:Your Education Minister recently proposed abolishing the traditional Quebecan school schedule, which included seasonal breaks, and replacing it with one in which school days were evenly distributed over an entire year. In response, concerned administrators, parents, and educators have asked for your support. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Everyone knows how much time parents and educators waste regurgitating the same information every year,” complains obnoxious parent Thundu Quayle, seen wearing a ‘My Child Is An Honor Roll Student’ button. “Students often forget things when they spend long periods of time without learning. In order for these young minds to flourish, we should keep the same number of weeks of education per annum, but spread them out evenly across the year. That will make my - I mean, Sascvencha’s - children’s successes even more pronounced!”
OPTION-1: “That is ridiculous. Can you even imagine all the overhaul that would require?” questions principal Bill Wonka, after giving two of your squabbling aides a time out. “The budget is strapped enough as it is! A better solution would be to allow each school to determine its own schedule. That’s better for the administrative workings of this public school system, and our finances. Besides, educators need breaks too! Teaching those little hellions is far more stressful than it looks!” The aides begin squabbling again, prompting a stern glare from the principal. “You two! My office! Now!”
OPTION-2: “Restructuring alone won’t keep our children ahead of the curve!” opines Gertie Duras, Comptroller of the Manitoba District School Board who had been grading everyone on their posture and speeches. “What we need to do is make education free and mandatory all year round, fifty-two weeks a year and six days a week. Yes, that means massive spending towards the education budget, but you can’t put a price on knowledge. Well, I guess you can depending on how much goes into the budget.”
