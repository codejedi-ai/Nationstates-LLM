TEXT:This morning, you were informed that the An AI Broadcasting Company is set to air a documentary on the legalization of needle exchanges in Skandilund. These provide sterile needles and allow safe injection sites for addicts to use recreational drugs without fear of arrest. Going by the small crowd gathered outside your office, it appears you weren’t the only one to hear about the documentary. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “My gorgeous little Ayla would have been saved if she’d been allowed to inject safely in a public place!” wails Othello, who lost his daughter to an intravenous heroin overdose last month. “She is not alone - thousands of people die preventable deaths every year as a result of this unfair policy. Not only should we legalize these safe sites, but also provide state counseling and rehabilitation for anybody that looks like she or he may be a drug addict. Why have one death when you can have none?”
OPTION-1: “I’ll just go out on an ominously scarred limb and say that this is a load of nonsense,” dryly notes retired sheriff Mia deVries, in between discrete sips from a hip flask. “Intervention this, inter-venal that, yet nobody seems to realize that keeping their mitts off drugs is the best way forward for us! Bringing this in would be as good as giving people the go ahead to break the law. We don’t want to encourage junkie scum who go around stealing everything that is not nailed down. We’ll just punish them like the other criminals.”
