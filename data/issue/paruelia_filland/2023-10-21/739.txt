TEXT:
When separated dad Elmo Santiago put his daughter Sue-Ann on the train, he made sure her mum knew the correct time and platform at which the child was due to arrive. He also arranged for a babysitter to travel with the tot, given that she was only two years old. Controversially, the babysitter was his son, himself only seven years of age. A train conductor noted both children travelling alone, and intervened by calling the police and social services.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “The only ****ing problem here is the ****ing train conductor ****ing interfering where he wasn’t ****ing wanted,” complains Kendra Gaudí, the mother of the two children, as she thrusts a sippy-cup containing Eckie-Cola at her resisting daughter. “We’ve been doing it this way for two ****ing years, and never had any ****ing problems. How about the government, the police, social services and all you other nosy ****s keep out of how we choose to deal with OUR ****ing children?”
OPTION-1: “This is about child safety!” exclaims Danni Mendeleev, the train conductor. “I mean, we actually have a reasonably priced service where we offer supervision to unattended children. What sort of lousy parent puts a seven-year-old in charge of a two-year-old? Frankly, if parents are too lazy to use the provisions, they shouldn’t be allowed to raise kids at all. You should invest in Child Protection Services, and extend their powers to take children into safe, governmental care when they’re being neglected by incompetent parents.”
OPTION-2: “If I might interject?” interrupts Pedro, the seven-year-old boy at the centre of the saga, as he changes his sister’s nappy. “Clearly capability varies from child to child, but some of us are obviously more advanced than others. While I accept <i>a priori</i> that adults are responsible for safeguarding the wellbeing of children, I think there’s room for flexibility in the interpretation of adulthood. Posit: Can we institute a formal test, to be applied for at any age, that is legally required to prove capacity to act <i>in loco parentis</i>? I’ve been reading up on the legal ins-and-outs, and it seems like a straightforward enough possibility. I’d be happy to help you draft something.”
