TEXT:Tragedy struck when commercial airline pilot Chijioke Snape deliberately crashed his airplane into a mountain, causing the death of the 416 passengers and 12 crew on board. Afterwards, a medical report was leaked to the press revealing that the pilot had been declared “unfit for work” and suicidal by his doctor, but had failed to report this information to his employer. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “What happened was the doctor’s fault!” complains the pilot’s brother, who is also blaming shoddy construction work for the broken door he kicked open to enter your office. “Had that quack reported the diagnosis to the airline, my beloved sibling would still be alive, as would all those other people. Pilots should be obliged to undergo regular mental evaluations and if someone is deemed unstable, the doctor should be required to report this to the aviation authorities.”
OPTION-1: “Look, the solution doesn’t have to involve breaches of confidentiality and invasions of privacy,” suggests a rep from the Federation Union of Commercial United Pilots. “The problem is a different one. Pilots in this country are completely mistreated, with airlines working them too hard for adequate mental health. It’s no wonder that some of them get depressed, or burn out. Airlines should be made to pay better wages, to provide more sociable hours, and to grant more paid downtime between flights.”
OPTION-2: “Are you insane?” interjects Hope Bonar, CEO of budget airline EasyBlues. “Do you have any idea how much that would cost us? Do you want to be the one who forces ticket prices up? This all happened because the pilot who crashed the damn plane locked the cockpit when his co-pilot stepped out for a few minutes. Just enact laws that keep both pilot and co-pilot in the cockpit at all times. Cuff them to their seats for the duration of the flight; that’ll stop them wandering.”
