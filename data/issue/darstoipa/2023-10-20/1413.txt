TEXT:Official inspectors visiting your nuclear launch silos have revealed that much of the equipment used is decades old, and that sourcing replacement parts for superseded technologies is becoming more difficult. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is an utter disgrace! Imagine how this obsolete trash would perform in the face of nuclear war!” spits General vonBismarck, pointing to the red ‘hotline’ rotary phone that connects to your office. “We’d all be dead before you can say ‘underfunded military’! You need to remedy this, and get new, state-of-the-art equipment and computers, with the latest versions of the best software on the market. Our nation’s safety depends on it!”
OPTION-1: “It’s not just a matter of cost,” complains your Treasury Minister, as he turns down the silo’s thermostat to reduce the heating bill. “An upgrade of this scale would cost us more than Dar Papers! It would mean abandoning tried and tested approaches, which we know are reliable and safe from hackers. And cheap. But mostly reliable and safe. I mean, we could still use this stuff, can’t we? Just buy any spare parts you need cheap from vBay or something. This isn’t about money! It isn’t!”
OPTION-2: “Woah, dude, WMDs are like, so uncool,” wails Private Chloe Cook, a hippie peacenik who accidentally enlisted while high, but has stuck around for the free food. “Why spend money on weapons of war, when you can spend it on, like... other stuff, man! You gotta make love, not war, guys.” She absent-mindedly offers you a toke from her spliff.
