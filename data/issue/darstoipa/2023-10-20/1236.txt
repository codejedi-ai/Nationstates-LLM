TEXT:A politician is attempting to have his name legally changed from Harry Butts to Honest Joe Johnson so it will look more appealing on the ballot, but his opponents are crying foul. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is an obvious ploy to manipulate voters,” says Zeke Santos, a candidate from an opposing party. “People shouldn’t be allowed to change their names. It’s too easy to abuse and all it does is confuse people.”
OPTION-1: “It’s my name, and I should be able to change it to anything I want,” Mr. Butts says with one of those plastic camera-ready smiles that politicians always seem to have. “I just want my name to reflect who I really am. As for the election, I’m sure the voters can be trusted to make the right decision.”
OPTION-2: “I’d trust that guy about as far as I can throw him,” says transgender rights activist Darius Assange. “He’s obviously trying to game the system and you shouldn’t allow it, but there are some people — like myself — who have legitimate reasons to change their names. You should let normal folk change their names,  but force politicians to use the names that they were given when they were born.”
OPTION-3: “Hey, what if we took this a step further?” says Jennifer Garza, one of your party’s more creative campaign strategists and successful parliamentarians. “As we’re listing names on the ballot, why don’t we have all our party’s candidates change their middle names just before the election to emphasise our key policies. We can use that space like a miniature campaign poster. Like my name, for example, would be Jennifer<i> ‘The Sun Shall Never Set On The Robotic Empire’</i> Garza. How could people resist voting for that?”
