TEXT:The thousand-year-old Crocodilefoot Glacier, located in northern Yes Enes, served as a natural dam for the Crocodile Lake. Yesterday it broke open, causing the lake’s contents to rush out into the valley below, destroying the downstream ecosystem and a nearby town. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This disaster is just another example of how human-accelerated climate change is destroying the natural world!” exclaims environmental activist Brandon Hackett, slowly heating up in anger. “Cars, factories, and excessive flatulence cause glaciers like the Crocodilefoot to melt prematurely! Soon, these beauties will be all but gone. Leader, you have to do something — speeches, environmental regulations, anything to stop the rising temperatures! Every person in Yes Enes has to know the consequences of their carelessness!”
OPTION-1: “Oh get out of here you whining hippy!” grumbles Hana Nguyen as she pushes her way into the room. “My town was flooded and my swimming pool was destroyed in this disaster. People may go homeless for who knows how long! Violet’s sake, your first priority should be to us, the average Yes Enesian, not some nonsense tree-loving wacko! Ensure that our tax francs are going right back towards rebuilding affected homes and businesses.”
OPTION-2: “It’s your own fault that you built a town smack-dab in the center of a potential flood pathway,” sighs self-described “preventionist” Luke Trump as he emerges from the floor in mining gear. “Everyone knows that areas within a seventeen-mile proximity of a glacier are in danger of flooding. Really, most of Yes Enes is vulnerable to some watery hazard, like the giant waterfall only a few miles from Yes Enes City! Why don’t we go ahead and move all the water out of the way with dams and drainage channels across the nation? I’ve taken the liberty of preparing a map listing potential areas in danger.” He shows you a map with an uncountable number of marks on it. “See here, here, here and here...”
