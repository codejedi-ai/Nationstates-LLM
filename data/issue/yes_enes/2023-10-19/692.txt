TEXT:A jet airliner recently made an emergency landing into the Crocodile River after an engine failed during takeoff. Footage has revealed the likely cause of the crash to be a drone sucked into one of the aircraft’s engines, and some are questioning the lack of regulations related to drone use. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “We’re lucky nobody was killed in the crash, but we might not be so fortunate next time,” murmurs Jerry Dodinas, your overzealous Public Safety Minister, while meticulously covering your letter opener with bubble wrap. “The problems with drones extends beyond planes, too. What if one falls out of the sky and decapitates an innocent bystander? We need sensible regulations of drones to make sure Yes Enesians are kept safe. The public should only use drones outside of populated areas, at low heights, and only after passing a safety class.”
OPTION-1: “We don’t need draconian regulations just because one idiot didn’t read the instructions,” rebuffs avid drone enthusiast Nelianneke Leach, while using a drone to film the meeting. “By that logic, we should ban microwaves, just because one person thought it was a fun idea to stick their head inside to see what would happen. It is the right of every citizen to enjoy everything drones have to offer. Besides, strict rules would blow drone sales out of the sky.”
OPTION-2: “Yes, private drones are a nuisance, but don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater,” begs Victor Santos, CEO of Pie In The Sky, a drone-based food delivery service. “You should ban private drone use, but allow unrestricted commercial drone use. Leader, let me tell you, the sky is the limit. Just think about drone package delivery, drone private investigators, even drone dog walkers. Perhaps we could talk more about it,” he gestures at a food-laden drone tapping at your office window, “over some lunch?”
