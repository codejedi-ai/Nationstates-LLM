TEXT:A report from your Intelligence Ministry reveals that an illegal lab deep in the jungles of Brasilistan has created several clones of the infamous genocidal dictator Lee Terallihitlah, a.k.a. “the Butcher of Bigtopia,” and placed them with adopted families scattered around the world, including some in Yes Enes. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “These children are a potential source of danger!” says death camp survivor Augustus Shiomi. “Think what would happen if one of them rose to power in Yes Enes and repeated Terallihitlah’s crimes here. They have to be put under surveillance to make sure that never happens. And if they turn out not to be as evil, then we ought to be monitoring them to protect them from those with a misplaced sense of vengeance against them. Either way, everybody is safest if we keep a close watch.”
OPTION-1: “That’s not enough!” yells Bigtopian human rights activist Fanny Bell. “What if someone marries them without knowing? What if they have kids? Terallihitlah systematically murdered millions of Bigtopians because he believed we were genetically inferior. We can’t allow his DNA to stay in the gene pool! These abominations must die!”
OPTION-2: “What is wrong with you people?” civil rights lawyer Kristian Grieg wants to know. “Don’t we have anything better to do than judge people by their DNA? These children aren’t Lee Terallihitlah and they haven’t done anything wrong. It should be illegal to discriminate against people based on their genes.”
OPTION-3: “Hey, like, maybe we can use this,” says controversial pop singer Britney Speer, as she bounces into your office dressed in a bizarre mix of sequins, body paint, and fascist regalia. “You can recruit the clones to work for you and have them travel the country promoting patriotism. What could possibly go wrong?”
