Today terror struck an antiques show when a would-be seller, unhappy with the price offered for his 200-year-old blunderbuss, decided instead to open fire. Luckily nobody was killed, seeing as the museum piece was wrestled off him during the minute and a half it was taking him to reload, but many are asking how the gun ban was so easily circumvented.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “Look, let’s not be too hasty in drawing conclusions,” says antiques vendor Tina Martinez, rubbing at the sore patch on her left buttock where a low velocity lead ball left a nasty bruise. “I must confess I was offering an insultingly small pittance for such a piece of history, but I have my own bottom line to look after! I believe that citizens should be able to keep such historic beauties that happen to be family heirlooms from before the ban. They certainly make these car-boot sales much more interesting!”
OPTION-1: Security guard Britney Snape glares at the previous speaker with one remaining eye. “Easy for you to say, that wound isn’t permanent! I knew something suspicious was going to happen as soon as that good for nothing lowlife walked in with that big boomstick. We got rid of the guns for a reason, and this is exactly it! I say we go from house-to-house and confiscate all remaining guns from the populace, no matter their age, legality or functionality!”
OPTION-2: “The law as it stands says that old pieces can be kept so long as they are deactivated,” suggests police officer Gyelbu Bottomley, who was hit by a small piece of shrapnel in the middle of his stomach. “The problem here isn’t that the weapon exists, but that it was so easily reactivated. We need to raise standards on how deactivation takes place, to make sure that antique weapons have no chance of being restored to working condition. Make deactivation more thorough, and also ban the sale of the spare weapon parts that make reactivation possible.”
