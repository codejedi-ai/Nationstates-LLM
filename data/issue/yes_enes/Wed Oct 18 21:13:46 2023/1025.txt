TEXT:The execution of convicted double-murderer Arabella Silk was carried out yesterday. The killer had no final statement, but in a spiteful act of defiance, ate mere morsels of her last meal - a six-course feast, which she had specifically requested just days prior. Concerned with the fact that over 8,000 calories were provided to a dead-woman-walking, and most of it ended up in the trash, many are calling for the condemned-row tradition of the “last meal” to be put to death. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “We need to remember the victims!” exclaims Erasmus Berenstain, director of one of the largest victims’ rights organizations in Yes Enes. “Did that killer ever give her victims a chance to eat a last meal? Absolutely not. Should Yes Enes allow the worst-of-the-worst to select comfort foods before their dates with death? Absolutely not. They deserve as much kindness and mercy as they gave to their victims - absolutely none! Do away with this so-called tradition! Let them eat whatever the prison is serving the general population on the given day of their execution.”
OPTION-1: “People on death row are still people,” explains death row exoneree Kitty Grossman. “I know from first-hand experience that the condemned might not be the best people around, but they still should be afforded the dignity of a proper last meal. Why deny them one final comfort before they meet their end?”
OPTION-2: “So let me get this straight: this bleeding-heart liberal thinks we should literally cater to convicted murderers?” questions notorious former prison warden Plutarch Myers. “These ‘people’, if they can still be referred to as such, deserve nothing but to quietly bide their time until they are put to death. In fact, forget last meals, these scum don’t deserve the meals they already receive! After all, we shouldn’t waste any food on death row trash, and if anyone deserves to be taught a lesson, it’s them!”
