TEXT:A startling new report has revealed that the 👬Spireatian👭 government’s website fails to meet even the most basic accessibility guidelines. In one case, deaf users were instructed to watch a fifteen-minute video with no subtitles in order to be eligible for government support. Following this revelation, disability rights groups are demanding action. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is degrading!” shouts disability advocate Ivanka McGhee, as she tries to reach a nearby microphone from her wheelchair. “Government should be designed for everyone, regardless of ability. We need to make sure that all taxpayer-funded websites are accessible for people with disabilities. How can we move forward when we leave our most vulnerable behind?”
OPTION-1: “Why stop there?” questions Communications Minister and keyboard warrior Moff Steele, furiously typing on his phone as he steps forward. “Plenty of websites are terrible for people with disabilities. We need to establish a new internet regulator to ensure that everything on the web is accessible! Plus, it will give me — um, I mean, the government — greater control over what can go online. What’s not to love?”
OPTION-3: “My dear, you mustn’t forget those of us who suffer from macular degeneration and other age-related disabilities,” interjects your grandmother, who appears to have nimbly evaded the staff from her nursing home. “How are we supposed to access government services if we can’t even read the blasted computer screens? Why not just go back to in-person service, with government offices in every town? We don’t need none of this fancy computer stuff. Some good ol’ fashioned pencil-pushing would do Spireatia some good.”
