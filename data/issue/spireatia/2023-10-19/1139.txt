TEXT:A dwarf wrestling tour was cut short after advocacy groups complained that it was demeaning. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Just look at this!” fumes three-foot-tall disabled rights activist Jabulani Stuckmann, waving around a poster that you can’t see for the top of your desk. “This isn’t a sporting event; this is a modern-day freak show. It even says they have a ‘midget toss’! I know the wrestlers agreed to participate, but they aren’t the only ones that have to live with the dehumanizing stereotypes. Spireatia shouldn’t tolerate entertainment that pokes fun at people for their size or disabilities.”
OPTION-1: Suddenly, a diminutive wrestler in brightly-colored spandex hurtles toward you, landing on your desk and knocking all your papers onto the floor. “Ha! What fun is life if you can’t laugh at yourself?” he says, as he rolls to his feet. “Maybe wrestling isn’t for everyone, but it’s a lot better than being unemployed or having some boring office job. We wrestlers are celebrating who we are - it’s not up to you to tell us what we can’t do. Instead, why don’t you give us some support and let us show everyone what we can do?”
OPTION-2: “You’re all thinking too small,” slobbers creepy endocrinologist Dr. Molly Butler, leering down over the head of the wrestler and gesticulating erratically. “You’ve got to look at the big picture. We wouldn’t have to worry about any of this if we had a cure for dwarfism, right? Well, I’ve just made a huge breakthrough in hormone treatments that would allow all these people to grow to a normal height, instead of being freakishly small. All I need is some funding to make my project a reality. Yes, that’s all...” She cackles maniacally, though it’s not clear what she is finding so funny.
