TEXT:Recent studies have concluded that the indoor air quality in 👬Spireatian👭 buildings often reaches unhealthy levels, leading to decreased comfort and productivity across the nation. That explains why all your meetings this morning were interrupted by the sounds of your assistants sneezing and coughing throughout the office. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “There’s a simple solution to this!” declares Amanda Iglesias, your ambitious Minister of Flashy Technology. “We’ve been experimenting with smart air purifiers that will clean all those pesky particulates out of your homes and workplaces, and they even come with a bright LED display that glows one of 500 different shades of red to tell the user exactly what the machine’s doing. Just build us a new factory where we can mass-produce them, and we’ll put those bad boys in every building in Spireatia!”
OPTION-2: “There’s no need to blow through money like that,” snuffles your runny-nosed Minister of Safety, still clutching the tissue box that she has been carrying all morning. “Many indoor air pollutants come from the organic compounds found in building materials, paint, and cleaning products. If we restrict the use of these chemicals, we’ll tackle the root of the problem, and we won’t have to worry about biting off more than we can a-a-CHEW!”
OPTION-3: “This wouldn’t be such a problem if people weren’t spending all their time inside,” rebuts lonely park ranger Ed Pound, who deserted his post to meet with you without anybody noticing. “If you invest in public parks, plazas, and hiking trails, I think you’ll see more people enjoying the great outdoors and less people complaining about this whole indoor air quality thing, since they won’t be exposed to it anymore! Well, not as much, anyway.”
OPTION-4: “New machines? New restrictions? You’re all absolutely insane!” interrupts a disgruntled old man who you don’t recall inviting to this meeting. “You know what we did back in my day when we wanted fresh air? That’s right, open a goddang window! You should just mandate that every building open all their windows for two hours a day. Problem solved.” The man then exits the room via the open window behind him.
