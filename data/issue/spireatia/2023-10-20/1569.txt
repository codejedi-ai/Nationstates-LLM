TEXT:Lee Kerr, a self-proclaimed “independent journalist” with ties to various foreign nations, is on the run from 👬Spireatian👭 police after being charged with espionage. In an attempt to evade justice, he took refuge in the Brancalandian embassy in ¥🎟️👑. After the Brancalandians formally granted him asylum, three of your advisors ambushed you during a meeting with another nation’s ambassador. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “That’s the third time this week a criminal’s managed to escape us by hiding in one of those damn embassies!” booms Police Commissioner Monica Kennett, dressed in full SWAT gear. “To hell with what anyone else thinks! If these other nations want to be on 👬Spireatian👭 land, they have to play by 👬Spireatian👭 rules. Allow us to storm whatever building we want and catch these cowardly terrorists once and for all. To keep the international kerfuffles to a minimum, we can temporarily revoke the embassy’s diplomatic rights and let the foreigners go home for a few hours while we make the arrest. If Brancaland has a problem with that, they can take it up with THIS.” She pulls a truncheon from her belt and thrusts it upward, hitting a nearby light fixture and sending shards of glass flying around the room.
OPTION-1: “Don’t listen to that nutter! Let’s come up with a more reasonable solution,” suggests your Minister for Foreign Appeasement, brushing bits of glass out of her hair. “Look, there’s no need for hullabaloo. We can’t let these scumbags get in the way of my job... I mean, the relationships and trust we have spent many years building up! We need to respect their territory and not step a single foot in these embassies without their permission. Let’s try catching these criminals through good old diplomacy — surely giving up their asylum seekers in exchange for reduced maple syrup tariffs is an offer Brancaland can’t refuse?”
OPTION-2: “Why should we give those Brancalandian ice weasels anything? The problem should sort itself out soon enough,” advises Minister of Practicalities Tommo Richards, while reviewing a dossier on the fugitive. “After a few months of having that loudmouth muckraker living in their embassy, spouting his nonsense conspiracy theories and attempting to sell everyone’s national secrets to the highest bidder, Brancaland will be looking for an excuse to give him the boot. If we station police officers at every possible exit point, we’ll be able to arrest him eventually. Let’s just hope that he doesn’t sell all of our top secret intel to Blackacre before that happens...”
OPTION-3: “You lot are such amateurs,” chides the ambassador from Althaniq, who was trying to persuade you to consider a camel exchange program when your advisors barged in. “You shouldn’t get pushed around like this, but you also shouldn’t go in guns blazing like a bunch of fools, or waste your time with a siege. Want to get rid of these asylum seekers and get away with it? Sneak a few operatives through the back door... and terminate with extreme prejudice.”
