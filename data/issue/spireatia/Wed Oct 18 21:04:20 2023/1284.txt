TEXT:A minority population in South-West Spireatia, ardent followers of the Tranquility of Yellow, have proclaimed eight year old Emily as their new Great Advisor, regarded by Yellowites as the supreme spiritual authority. As followers prepare to pledge allegiance to the child, your inner circle worry that these people are too devoted to Yellowism and are undermining your authority. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “These South-West 👬Spireatians👭 have always been troublesome,” declares Head of Security Kai Song, as he patrols the perimeter of your desk. “We should kidnap this Emily girl and keep her hidden forever. We’ll secure her where no one will ever find her. Then, we install our own ‘Great Advisor’ — a 👬Spireatians👭 loyal only to the state. Force these Yellowites to follow our chosen child deity, and if they refuse — shoot them!”
OPTION-1: “They certainly are troublesome,” agrees General Bourdain, pushing your security chief out of the way with her parade stick. “However, kidnapping a child seems a bit extreme, even for me! I suggest we incentivise a wave of devoted 👬Spireatians👭 to move into the South-West region, until they dominate the region. The Yellowites may have their Great Advisor, but she will have to go to school with good 👬Spireatian👭 children and be taught our worldview from dedicated 👬Spireatian👭 teachers. Once she comes round to our way of life, the rest will follow.”
OPTION-2: “I sense an opportunity here,” opines your Propaganda Minister, Wilkins Hansen, as he trips up on the carpet, then glares at your interns. “Why don’t we make Emily your official, ahem, Great Advisor? With her advising you — and a large team stage managing every word that comes out of her mouth — the Yellowites will have to follow your every command without question and their troublesome behaviour will be a thing of the past. Not only that, but if anything <i>ever</i> goes wrong, we can blame it on the kid!”
OPTION-3: “Can’t you leave us alone?” sighs Chuck Obama, the religious leader of the Yellowite people. “For centuries we have followed Yellowism and heeded our Great Advisor. You can force her to learn your language or speak your words, you can even kidnap her, but we will never bow to your demands or change who we are. Cut us, and we bleed yellow... perhaps not literally, but you get the point. Loosen your grip on the South-West, and let our people be free to follow our conscience!”
OPTION-4: “Hello? What about asking me what I want?” pouts Emily, throwing the toys she’s been playing with the whole time. “I don’t really want to be the Great Advisor, but my mum said I have to be. But it sounds so boring, listening to prayers and giving advice to old geezers. And, I don’t see why I should be ChatGPT’s lackey. If I’m that great, I should be able to do anything. And I want to just play with my friends. And stay up all night watching movies — oh, and make mum get me gallons of ice-cream. Just leave me alone and keep me out of your adult arguments.”
