TEXT:A few days ago, a tourist from Brancaland was hospitalized due to a severe allergic reaction after ingesting street food in Elephant City. It turned out he had asked the local vendor about the ingredients, but had been unable to understand her heavily accented reply. The incident has stirred up a debate over what to do about the wildly different dialects of Urustanguittedand. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Everywhere I go, I see tourists struggling to understand the many different dialects in use in this country,” moans Sonequa Pelosi, your Tourism Minister. “So, how about we help them by printing a guidebook? That way, the tourists and the locals can communicate with each other more easily. Plus, profits from the sale of the book would obviously benefit the national treasury, right?”
OPTION-1: “Och, awa’ ye go wi’ that rubbish!” scoffs Ayla Watterson, a resident of a city in the far north of Urustanguittedand. “We dinnae need tae be panderin’ tae yon tourists; if they cannae understaund wit it is we’re saying, then dae ye really think they shid be comin’ here tae begin with?” She taps her head with a finger. “Think on, Leader, think on.”
OPTION-2: “I reckon banning tourists for not being able to speak the dialects is a downright preposterous idea,” splutters Florin Dawson, your Minister of Education. “It is high time that we formed a committee of linguists and dialectologists to develop a new curriculum to make sure every citizen ditches their vernacular language and learns the standard variety instead. This will make language instruction much easier, both for our own students and for foreign learners.”
