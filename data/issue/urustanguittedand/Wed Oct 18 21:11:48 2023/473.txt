TEXT:An enterprising Urustanguittedandian citizen has begun manufacturing matryoshka dolls of legendary pop star Jack Michaelson without his permission. In response, his management company has been spectacularly persistent in demanding royalties from the dolls’ sales. Contract lawyers, dressed as zombies and petitioning with uncanny rhythm, are camped around the clock outside of the capitol. Tired of the incessant pop music, you have sat down to negotiate a solution. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “I’m thrilled to finally settle this problem,” says Jack Michaelson while moonwalking back and forth in your office, “You see, the matryoshka manufacturers are exploiting my likeness without my permission. That’s theft unless I get a cut. Anyone who disagrees can just beat it.” The pop star exits with his pet monkey in tow.
OPTION-1: Entrepreneur Wilbur Trudeau lays a bizarre assortment of white glove-themed matryoshka dolls on your desk. “These are original works of art that the record label did nothing to create. Just because my work may RESEMBLE famous people like, say Mr. Michaelson or yourself, doesn’t mean I’ve stolen anything. It’s not so black and white, the question of image laws.”
OPTION-2: “You’re forgetting the bigger problem,” pontificates Christopher Clarke, while carving a matryoshka doll in the old style, “These pop art abominations are ruining our Urustanguittedandian culture. I’m sick and tired of foreign pop music and other trash drowning out our national customs. Tradition dictates that a matryoshka doll is a series of nested babushki, not postmodern kitsch like political figures and disco stars.”
