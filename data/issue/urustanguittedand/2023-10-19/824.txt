TEXT:Tonight’s big family dinner seemed like such a nice idea. Alas, it’s all descended into awkward silences and short tempers again. This is mostly thanks to your sister’s complaints about the high price of feminine sanitary products, which she largely attributes to the so-called “tampon tax”: a sales tariff on these items. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “It’s a bloody outrage! The patriarchy seems to believe that tampons and pads aren’t essentials,” rails your sister Liara, waving a grocery receipt under your nose. “You have to stop taxing feminine products! If the income stream is so important to you, stick it on income tax instead! Women everywhere are demanding change. Can’t you go with the flow?”
OPTION-1: “Don’t make a scene, dear,” soothes your mother, patting her on the shoulder. “If the prices are bleeding you dry or cramping your style, I’m sure your dear sibling will have the state buy them for you, and for all Urustanguittedand’s ladies. That’s what government is for, isn’t it darling?”
OPTION-2: “Ugh, I can’t believe that your sister would even talk about such things at the dinner table,” moans Uncle Chepal, handing out copies of his self-published pamphlet, <i>Women: For Pity’s Sake, Don’t Talk</i>. “It completely put me off my borscht. If it were up to me, I’d make it a crime to publicly discuss women’s monthly troubles. Some things are best kept private, period!”
OPTION-3: “Let’s try and be balanced here,” whispers your Treasury Minister Roman Norris, wishing he’d never accepted the invitation to your family home. “Sales tax is vital to help keep the burden of income tax down, but it’s a good thing to be equitable. Why not add sales tax to men’s daily goods like razors and shaving cream? That way, everybody pays their fair share.”
