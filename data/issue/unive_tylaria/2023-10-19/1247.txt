TEXT:A patient accused Ward Nurse Sanjeev Rios of an inappropriately intimate physical examination, which resulted in his suspension from duty at Unive Tylaria City Central Hospital. A series of investigations and legal meetings followed, involving hospital management, the patient ombudsman, the complaints review board, and eventually a magistrate’s court of appeal. All in all, the nurse was suspended for a total of nine months before the complaint was dismissed and he was fully exonerated. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “There’s no protection for the reputation of professionals anymore,” rants the accused nurse, waving a loaded syringe around as he speaks, spraying an unknown sticky white fluid in your face. “My name was in the local paper! The girl I was dating dumped me! Look, of course we must allow complaints. However, once a complaint has been dismissed, we should be able to take false accusers to court to hold them to account. I want compensation for my losses, one way or another.” He leers disturbingly with this last statement.
OPTION-1: “Why doesn’t anyone believe me?” sobs Ivanka Zukerburg, the complainant who levelled the allegations, as she surreptitiously peels an onion under the table. “For the sake of victims everywhere, you have to weigh in to protect people like me. Do you know how scary it was for me to come forward with this? You owe it to patient safety to trust the word of victims, and to permanently suspend perverts like this nurse!”
OPTION-2: “As far as I can see, this whole problem has happened because it’s one person’s word against another,” observes your Minister of Watching Watchmen. “We ought to enforce some transparency to medical proceedings, with every professional accompanied by a trained observer for all interactions, and each patient also encouraged to bring their own chaperone. That way, there’ll always be at least one impartial observer to verify witness accounts.”
