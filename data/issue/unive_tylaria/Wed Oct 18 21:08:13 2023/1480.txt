TEXT:Former child star ‘Jolly’ Jacquetta Cogan featured in 45 films between the ages of three and eleven years, earning a vast fortune. Jacquetta is now of age, and has made a shocking discovery: of her once-great wealth, there is now only a handful of ¥🎟️s left. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “My money was stolen by my mother,” insists Jacquetta, not breaking into one of her trademark tap dances to turn that frown upside down. “When I was eleven, I had enough money to live well for the rest of my life. But my mother has since spent every ¥🎟️ on diamond jewellery, luxury holidays and a private island for her poodle. You have to ensure all earnings of a child performer are held in trust until the child is of age, and that any monies already spent for any reason are paid back.”
OPTION-1: “Simply put, a parent has legal control of both offspring and finances <i></i>’til adulthood,” drawls Imogen Cogan, lifting her wrist with difficulty to glance at her diamond-laden watch. “To interfere with that would disrupt the natural parent-child relationship, and teach a child to disrespect their parent’s choices. And, she forgets, I bought things for her, too. Fed her, even after directors wouldn’t cast her any more. I don’t ask for my money back. Anyway, she was only ever playing in front of a camera. Do children get paid for make-believe?”
OPTION-2: A young girl runs up to you, holding a box of part-eaten cookies. “Wait! Parents using child actors like piggy-banks is just mean, but my family only eats this week if I get this <i>Bicquick</i> commercial  ‘my mummy says they’re scrummy in your tummy; now with honey’. I don’t want my family to starve <i></i>’til I’m a grown-up. Maybe our parents can just buy what they need to take good care of us, and your government can check they’re not buying silly things with our money and saving some for our futures. By the way, did I sound like a Bicquick Girl? I really hate them.”
