ISSUE:
1062
TEXT:
Blackacre, a nation historically opposed to Unive Tylaria, has declared that their submarine <i>Violet November</i> has gone missing, and are keen to scour the area where it was last spotted — just off the edge of the 👬Unive Tylarian👭 continental shelf.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, Leader,” says Tyrone Lancaster, a diminutive Blackacrean ambassador. “Our submarine was just a training vessel that got erm... blown off course... or something. But the main issue here is saving the thirty crew members that are on board before their oxygen runs out! Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated: freedom of movement for our search boats, logistical aid, rescue teams, engineers... This is such a great opportunity for our two nations to start on a path towards greater friendship.”
OPTION-1: “A training vessel? Yeah! Right!” exclaims Rear Admiral Wong as the ambassador leaves your office. “I bet all my navy ribbons that we’re talking about a spy sub or a nuke platform! Those Blackacreans are always stirring up trouble and encroaching into our territorial waters. You should have our own submarines, frigates and destroyers search out and destroy unauthorised military vessels, including this sub, once we find it! That will give them something to think about before trespassing here again.”
