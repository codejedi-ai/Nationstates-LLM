TEXT:Gigantic data centers are cropping up all across Unive Tylaria. While they are essential to meet the snowballing demand for data processing underpinning most aspects of modern life, there are concerns about how their need for efficient cooling devices affects local communities. While out sauntering around the countryside in rural Unive Tylaria, you meet an electrical engineer with a fishing rod and an old farmer with sad eyes. You find them bickering with a data center representative about the fact that the usually unruffled Tuna Lake is now just one-third the size of what it used to be, due to it being used to cool nearby data centers. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “I’m telling you, Two-Phase Immersion Cooling would solve everyone’s problems,” asserts the engineer, while kicking up dust from the dried-out banks of the lake and rattling his tackle box in frustration. “It’s a new type of technology that uses dielectric heat transfer liquid instead of water. It could still be improved upon, sure, but with a little government funding, or rather a great deal of funding, you can have it installed everywhere in no time. Well, maybe some time. Just hurry up, all my favorite fishing spots are shriveling!”
OPTION-1: “Don’t fall for his bait,” smiles Jessica Primrose Bézeaux, the energetic owner of many of the nearby facilities, who carries a pair of giant scissors to cut the ceremonial ribbon at yet another data center down the road. “Using water for cooling is the industrial standard, it works, and it is much cheaper! Leave us alone, and I promise we’ll get some guys to look at utilizing the water more efficiently, and maybe throw a few ¥🎟️s towards local conservation and replenishment projects.”
OPTION-3: “Those fancy computer houses are killing my crops,” remarks the old farmer, his pitchfork a bit too close for comfort. “I say you make them city folks take these ugly buildings down. Then maybe I can get a decent harvest of potatoes again.” He hands you a bag of homemade chips, which are not of the micro kind, much to your dismay.
