TEXT:For the past few months, your administration has been working on a landmark trade deal with the historically hostile nation of Blackacre. On the eve of the agreement’s planned signing, Georgia Mormont — a high-ranking official from the Blackacrean government — has approached you with the intent to defect. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “If we upset the Blackacreans, months of planning could go to waste!” whispers your suspicious Minister of Pragmatism as he glares at the visibly trembling Blackacrean advisor. “Blackacre would never allow their Chief of Staff to defect! We have to turn her away and report this to Blackacre. It may be cold, but I stand — I mean, <i>we</i> stand to make a lot from this trade deal. This agreement could be the path to a long-lasting peace between our two nations — don’t let a single defector stand in our way.”
OPTION-1: “Leader, please don’t abandon me!” quietly pleads Mormont, as she pulls you into a secluded corner of the room. “I’m almost absolutely sure that they’ve discovered my intentions to defect by now. If you don’t protect me, the secret police will be sure to ‘disappear’ me. Let me stay and I will give you valuable information that you could use against Blackacre. Trade deals might be valuable, but trust me, the secrets I know are worth so much more. Want to know where their secret nuclear missile launch sites are? Yes, I thought you would...”
OPTION-2: “I agree that they’d never let her defect,” comments your shady Intelligence Minister, as he escorts you out of the room. “Which is why I’m surprised she’s here — the Blackacrean Supreme Leader keeps close watch on all of her subordinates. She must have been sent here to spy on us, but that’s fine. We’ll feed her dirty intel, track her communications, and who knows? We could find ourselves a spy network, right here in Unive Tylaria. I’m sure you’ll agree this is the best course of action, hmm?”
