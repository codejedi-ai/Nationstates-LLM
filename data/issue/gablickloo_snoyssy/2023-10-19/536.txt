TEXT:In remote villages of Western Gablickloo Snoyssy, mobs of angry villagers have taken to lynching women accused of witchcraft. Concerned citizens have come to you for answers. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Well, someone had to do it!” yelps self-appointed head of one of the border town’s lynch mobs, Edward Salem. “That lady was commitin’ witcheries left and right, turned my nephew into a newt she did! I mean... he got better, but that’s besides the point! The gov’ment needs to let us protect ourselves and rid our peace lovin’ towns of these foul she-devils!”
OPTION-1: “No no, that won’t work,” says a tall, dark-haired mysterious stranger walking into your office with a gust of wind stirring his long duster coat and hat. He throws a crossbow onto your desk before continuing, “These simple folk do not have the honed skills to hunt witches or any other devil of the night for that matter. But I am a monster hunter. If you set up a sanctioned guild, then we can properly hunt these necromancers.”
OPTION-2: “We’d appreciate it if you would all kindly mind your own business,” chastises Hermione Potter, who is dressed in a long black robe and pointed hat. “Our traditions are centuries old, and it is about time the government stepped in and protected us. You’d do well to build us a proper school away from these barbar— oh honestly Ronald, give me that,” she takes a carved wand from a young red-headed boy, “it’s Lo-go-phil-ia Levi-o-sa, make the phil nice and long.”
OPTION-3: “Where shall I begin?” coolly starts the head of the local planetarium, Dr. Carl deLawne Dyson. “These people, these simple farmers, they are taking what they don’t understand and they are calling it witchery. This sort of unsubstantiated ignorance must be stamped out. There is no such thing as witches, plain and simple. We need to start working towards a future free from these backwards superstitions at whatever cost.”
