The all-female remake of the cult camp comedy film <i>Ghost-Smashers</i> is the latest in a string of controversial female reboots of beloved media franchises. This trend has not gone unnoticed by the blogosphere, which has been alight with uneven reviews, some applause and thirty-page dissections of each line.
OPTIONS:
OPTION-0: “This is a desecration of a classic,” reads a rant from the blog of InternetGenius72, who boasts in his bio that he is forty-five and can quote every line of the original <i>Ghost-Smashers</i> backwards. “The original wasn’t about four chicks; it was about four <i>dudes</i>, okay? Four dudes with cool shades and boilersuits and short-wave sonic matter-busters. Now, they’ve turned it into four chicks, with <i>families</i> and <i>feelings</i> and they replaced the matter-buster with an ionising particle-blaster. What’s next? The maverick cop movie <i>Dirty Harold</i> remade as <i>Dirty Harriet</i>? I’m not a sexist or anything, but I want people to stop tampering with the classics. Filmmakers should make something new — remakes and sequels always suck.”
OPTION-1: “The female-led reimagining of the iconic <i>Ghost-Smashers</i> is one small step to placing women in the driving seat of Gablickloo Snoyssyian cinema, and I say it’s about bloody time!” shouts the host of feminist panel-show <i>HERstory</i>, looking nonplussed when people in the room don’t cheer. “Gablickloo Snoyssyian media has traditionally portrayed manhood as strong and powerful, while womanhood is depicted as the sweet and subservient helpmeet. Well, I say we promote media that show men being sweet and women being the tough leaders of tomorrow they were born to be. Can I get a whoop-whoop?”
OPTION-2: Your computer pings with a message: “My name is Declan, and I represent The Gablickloo Snoyssyian Kings, which aims to rebalance the power between men and these hussies. First, they got the vote, but that wasn’t enough. Now they ruin our movies, looking without shame down camera lenses and swearing and flirting with men who don’t even deserve a woman. All while taking great parts from good men who would’ve been great actors. It’s time you put these uppity slatterns back in their place. Ban womenfolk from playing any role that doesn’t portray modest, sweet and submissive ladylike behaviour. P.S. Porn is fine.”
OPTION-3: “All these people are crazy,” mutters Noddy Fitzgerald of the Gablickloo Snoyssyian Film Appreciation Society. “Nevertheless, it has to be said that there has been something of a dearth of quality parts for women and minorities. And this <i>Ghoulie-Hitters</i> — is that right? — hardly seems to redress the balance with its gaudy effects and lack of nuanced characterisation. We must fund high-quality films that provide meaningful and intelligent roles depicting the trials of three-dimensional Gablickloo Snoyssyian men and women of all backgrounds. Loud whizz-bang effects may be more attention-getting, but it’s the stories and the people that truly matter.”
