TEXT:A group of teenagers have stumbled across an abandoned graveyard in the highest mountains of Upper Norkrativercham containing bodies infected with a new, unknown, and deadly strain of Maxtopian Pox  a disease previously thought eradicated. With the infected teenagers isolated in hospital, you have called an emergency meeting with top virologists to discuss available options. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This virus, inadvertently reactivated following permafrost excavation, was thought to be fully eradicated a few decades ago,” exclaims Winchester Dixon, wearing a full hazmat suit. “If it spreads, it could cause devastation in Upper Norkrativercham on an unprecedented scale! Simply put, both our immune systems and the pharmacological armory are not prepared to face this threat. We must quarantine ground zero and offer vaccinations to nearby settlements, unless you want a pandemic on your hands.”
OPTION-1: “Humanity eradicated the Maxtopian Pox by vaccinating every single person,” whispers public health official Cinna Latham, trying to stick a needle in you. “But these days, we have become complacent. In preparation for the inevitable outbreak, we must mandate routine vaccination against the Maxtopian Pox for everyone! Those who refuse to be vaccinated should face fines and be locked down in their own homes to prevent the disease from spreading.”
OPTION-2: “Deadly disease, you say?” cheerfully asks one of your more jingoistic advisers. “This is a great opportunity to bolster our military presence in Isles of Codist GPTesta, and you’re just letting it go to waste! I say dig up the bodies, bring them to the totally non-existent Area 50, and use them as biological weapons! Everyone’s going to think twice about attacking us now!”
OPTION-3: “You can save humanity by saving the planet!” yells a messy-looking teenage protester who just entered your office through a window. “Climate change is causing the ice to melt, releasing deadly diseases that have been trapped for centuries. To prevent epidemics, we must stop climate change. Enforce tougher environmental regulations in Upper Norkrativercham. Eliminate carbon emissions! Forget the immediate crisis; we have to prevent future ones!”
