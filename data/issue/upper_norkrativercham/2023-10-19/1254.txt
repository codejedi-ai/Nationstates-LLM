TEXT:Commuting train passengers are complaining about unofficial vendors trying to sell things to them. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “These people are annoying and outrageous,” screams commuter Christopher Fallon, getting so far into your personal space that he is treading on your toes. “I ride the metro every day to go to work, and I’m constantly harassed by these noisy vendors! I have to yell down my phone so my clients are able to hear what I’m saying. You have to ban all vendors from trains immediately!” 
OPTION-1: Freelance vendor Indira Magellan strides into your office confidently, carrying a box of crackers. “I sell dem crackers on trains and buses every day, and dat’s how I make a livin’! People buys dem too, so clearly they wants me there! I reckon dem government should get outta’ the way and let people earn a few bitcoins.” She waves a small bag of ROTS® crackers in your face. “Buy dem now, buy three get one free!”
OPTION-2: Late to the meeting, and with a messy stack of disorganized papers in his arms, your Minister of Finance shows up. “We must acknowledge that a sizeable portion of some citizens’ incomes comes from these entrepreneurial activities, but equally, we should have some level of regulation by selling official retail licenses, which in turn will boost the national treasury. After all, we deserve our share. These are free samples, yes?” He helps himself to a bag of crackers, and walks out.
