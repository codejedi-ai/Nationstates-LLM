TEXT:A group of ‘concerned compatriots’ (Citizens Raging Against the Police) have protested against the enormous numbers of police officers enforcing the law on their daily lives. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “I’m constantly surrounded by over-zealous policemen!” deplores Jill Mombota, a spokesperson for the group. “Just last week I was arrested for letting my baby cry too loudly in public! This is ridiculous! The government needs to cut back the police force and let citizens get on with their lives without interference! If that means allowing muggers, thieves, burglars, pickpockets, murderers and all the rest to not have coppers breathing down the back of their necks constantly then so be it! This really is too much!”
OPTION-1: “You can’t listen to what they’re saying!” gasps Police Chief Newt Svensson, horrified. “These nuts would have us living in utter anarchy! If some robbers suddenly decide to break into a shop and steal everything, what’s the owner going to do? What could anyone do without a well-funded police force? There has to be justice and law or we’d be nothing better than a bunch of savages. Stick to your guns, I say, and let me arrest these subversives - people need to be taught to show some respect!”
