TEXT:During a press briefing, which had somehow been booked at a landscaping business on the rough side of town, one of your aides received a vicious paper cut. Almost immediately, your entourage found itself being led towards a set of dilapidated buildings to seek care. What your staff had mistaken for abandoned apartments turned out to be a hospital  a stark contrast to the world-class medical facilities in the posh enclaves across town. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “For decades our health and well-being have been neglected, and we wont take it any longer!” declares exasperated local resident Indira Lawson, lingering next to you in the waiting room. “Are we not Upper Norkrativerchamian, too? My neighborhood shouldnt determine the quality of the healthcare facilities I visit, and I shouldnt have to sit in a dingy waiting room for hours just to see an overworked triage nurse who’s already got twenty other patients! We demand more health subsidies for poor neighborhoods, and hey, maybe you can require that junior doctors serve in our hospitals for a few years, as a condition for getting their full license?”
OPTION-1: “The problem isn’t the resources they have  it’s how they use them! Did you read about all the fraud, waste, and abuse going on?” interjects Minister of Health Merrell Sandler, flipping through a spiral-bound copy of his ministrys latest several-hundred-page report. “Hospitals like this are typically poorly equipped, poorly maintained, and churn through staff, because their administration is too busy paying for executive washrooms in their offices, and ‘management retreats’ at fancy resorts. What they really need is additional oversight! Allocate funds to my budget and I’ll enact more stringent regulations, with routine inspections to ensure all hospitals are up to par.”
OPTION-2: “You can’t put a bandage on a fourth degree burn and expect it to heal!” cries the hospital’s head surgeon, suddenly leaping into the room with a reflex hammer in one hand and a diagram of a sickle cell in the other. “This is a symptom of that great plague upon our nation: for-profit healthcare! The rich can afford luxury treatment while the poor suffer in dirty, understaffed hospitals, all while insurance and pharmaceutical companies profit off their hardship. The solution is clear: nationalize healthcare, and let us provide equal care for all, regardless of residence, finance, or social class!”
OPTION-3: “If you don’t like the healthcare youre getting, pack up and move,” butts-in Siko Bacon, a ‘self-made’ businesswoman here performing community service after her most recent public escapades got reported to authorities. “What makes Upper Norkrativercham so great is that if you’re unhappy with your current conditions, you can change them with just a little hard work. The government doesnt need to spend all this unnecessary money or make weird, complicated regulations. Instead, you should drastically cut your healthcare spending. That will encourage these unhappy people to find better jobs and improve their own circumstances. Its the Upper Norkrativerchamian way!”
