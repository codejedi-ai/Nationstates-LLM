TEXT:Last week, a humanoid robot announced its intentions to serve as the nation’s first android federal judge. Concerned citizens have come to you as to the implications and legality of this potential appointment. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Surely we cannot allow this, right?” asks Chief Justice Quentin Romero while curling the end of his beard around his finger. “Letting them vote would be one thing, but robot judges? What if it malfunctions or someone tampers with it? We need to put an end to this right now. If we manufactured it, it shouldn’t be allowed to serve in the judiciary.”
OPTION-2: “He’s a— it’s a WHAT?” yells Oprah Allen, your Minister of Zero Tolerance. “This robot had to be made by someone right? You don’t see how that could go horribly, horribly wrong? It’s clearly a power grab by someone with deep connections at the Friendly Robot Company. We need to conduct a full on investigation of the entire industry and this robot; who made him, who paid for him, what he is capable of — the works!”
OPTION-3: “If I may disagree,” politely asks iCroft Holmes, the robot nominee. “A robotic judge has numerous benefits that the esteemed gentlemen are deliberately omitting. We can view decisions in a rational and analytical manner, unburdened by emotions. We would make decisions for the betterment of the people. The judiciary would become streamlined and efficient. Surely, these are virtues the government wants?”
OPTION-5: “I warned you!” scolds noted technophobe Wilkins Fowler after smashing your telephone. “But no one would listen. You became dependent on these soulless machines, integrated them into every facet of your lives, and look, now they dare to judge us! We’ve got to rid Blingeritaces of these toasters once and for all! Ban artificial intelligence and bring some sanity back to our country!”
