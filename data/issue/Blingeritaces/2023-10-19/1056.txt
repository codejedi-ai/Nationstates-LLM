TEXT:After a tired nurse working a hundred-hour week accidentally gave a series of injections to the wrong patient, there have been calls from some for a maximum number of hours someone can work in a week. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “A rigidly-enforced Working Time Directive should cap anyone from working more than 74 hours 22 minutes per week, with no more than 11.75 hours per shift,” definitively states analyst Mia Räikkönen, presenting you with a stack of hand-written calculations. “This will benefit safety, health, and quality of life, while also creating more jobs within the economy.”
OPTION-1: “I wake, I work, I sleep,” sneers multi-millionaire entrepreneur Taika Wright, attempting to pour himself a cup of coffee from a decorative vase on your desk. “No-one forced me to do this except myself. Turns out though, pushing yourself harder makes you successful. Don’t close the door on opportunity by interfering with people’s working lives. It’s bad for business, and bad for the economy.”
OPTION-2: “Let’s strike a reasonable middle ground!” proposes your hyperactive Employment Minister Balthazar Ebert, striking a ‘middle ground pose’ that involves balancing on one leg while pointing rapidly in multiple directions. “We need a comprehensive review to identify professions where there is risk to the public from long hours, and then create tailored directives for each field of work, and then create allowances for longer weeks followed by time off, and limited opt out clauses for extenuating circumstances, and, and... that sounds fun! Let’s get started!” He skips off, giggling maniacally.
