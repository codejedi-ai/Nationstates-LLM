TEXT:The unlikely romance between your nephew Rodney and Princess Julietta, the second daughter of the King of Moltevino, has been the talk of Isles of Codist GPTesta for many months. However, it hit a snag when the young couple decided to make a long-term commitment. Moltevino refuses to sanction such a match, as your nephew is not of royal blood. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “The King of Moltevino extends his noble hand in friendship,” declares Moltevino’s ambassador Lord Capello between tightly clenched lips, half-bowing. “Our fair kingdom has been enriched by exports of our many grape-based products and would like to share that glory through a favorable trade agreement. The King has one small request in return: lock your threadbare juggler of a nephew away from the Pearl of Moltevino, burn all his mad-headed ravings of love, and keep that rancorous coxcomb confined until he has foresworn all ties that he claims existed between himself and the Princess. Her Radiance isn’t a hedge-born puterelle who should be consorting with commoners! No offence intended.”
OPTION-1: “Pathetic little Moltevino is trying to push us around?” scoffs the Minister of Ego-Boosting. “You could spit from one side of their country and hit the other side! Their only notable export is wine. Granted, it’s damn good wine, but we still have Marche Noire. Let good old Princess Jules come and live in Blingeritaces. What are the Moltevinans gonna do? Invade us to get their ‘Pearl’ back? With what  their army of three pensioners, two cowards, and one courageous golden retriever named ‘Cuddles’? I’d like to see them try!” 
OPTION-3: “Fair Moltevino has so much more than wine,” exhorts Everly Matsenjwa, the Minister of Culture, as she holds up a brochure. “Look at this: meandering river cruises through wine country, historic architecture, Lovers’ Clock in the <i>piazza vecchia</i>. Perhaps an influx of tourist cash might be the tie that binds this lovers’ knot, through a story that shouldn’t be forgot. The young couple could settle in their preferred nation, and in return we would help promote Moltevino as a major tourist destination. Lots of sightseers visiting romantic places can put a smile on even the grumpiest of kings’ faces. For never was a story marketed better, than that of Rodney and his Julietta.”
OPTION-4: “Oh, just become a monarch,” shrugs your laziest nephew, Raphael, who’s just been fired after one day at his latest in a long line of jobs. “Come on, you waving to the people from balconies, talking about ‘royal unions between two nations, both alike in dignity’... folks’d love it! Then Rodney would be ‘His Royal Highness Rodney of Blingeritaces’ and I’d never have to work again... I mean, and he could be with the Princess. Wouldn’t that be cool?”
