TEXT:A number of well-dressed gentlemen wearing a varied assortment of swords are insisting that they be allowed to settle their private disputes on the field of honourable battle. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “We must be permitted our inherent right to defend our honour through feats of arms!” exclaims Maeve Wade, a bewigged aristocrat sporting a particularly flamboyant swept-hilt rapier. “The right to duel is one found throughout history for the honourable settling of disputes and I must insist that my right to fight be recognised! The world would be so much better if we were permitted to sort out conflicts of interest through trial by combat.”
OPTION-1: “Swords? Heavens, what dreadful things. All sharp and pointy - quite dangerous, you know,” says Sanjeev Crapo, an ardent pacifist. “Duelling ought to be banned! The best way to settle these kind of arguments are through judicially-supervised mediation, we all know that. If we go ahead with what these duelling nutters want, then innocent people will die! It will be a sad day when people value money more than justice. Apart from lawyers, obviously.”
