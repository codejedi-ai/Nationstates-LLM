TEXT:Dozens of children were seriously injured last week, during <i>Kick a Ginger Day</i>, the traditional start-of-term ritual in which generations of redheaded children at <i>Fox Lake Secondary School</i> have been attacked by their classmates. The Principal says their staff, notably devoid of redheads, were out to lunch and heard nothing of the rampage. Sensing a photo-op, you have cancelled your Step-Yoga class and headed over to the school to meet the parents. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “THIS IS BULLYING!” yells civil-rights activist and parent of redheaded twins, Brenda MacDonald, showing you a photograph of her children in hospital beds. “It is unconscionable for me to even think that my poor daughters were beaten for something they can’t control! All children should be treated equally, regardless of their hair color. What if it was ‘Bash a Blonde Day’? Would <i>that</i> be okay? I say we must take a hard line on all forms of bullying in our schools, and wipe it out: teasing, joking, badinage, poking fun, mockery, harrying, pestering...”
OPTION-1: “Bullying? Please! Now what are those liberal ninnies whining about?” scoffs Gwilym Harker, whose brown-haired son, Paxton, participated in the ritual kicking. “They were foot nudges, uncomfortable for a minute. Two, maybe. Not harmful at all. This is really the erosion of our traditions by the left-wing elite, the suppression of childish high spirits by folks who’d see them become tax-payin’ tree-huggin’ robots. Why, we did it all the time when I was a kid. At the end, all the normal kids give those weird gingers a hearty thump on the back, accepting ‘em as good sports. And they like that. Keep the nanny state out of the playground, and respect our ancient traditions.”
OPTION-2: “Rubbish!” snorts Maria Biscuitbarrel, an avid foxball fan, who is watching the televised play-offs on her <i>Pear Phone Grande</i> and has barely looked at her daughter since she arrived. “Getting kids to be nice, allowing kids to beat each other up. What kids <i>really</i> need is daily contact sports to work off that energy. Once you thrash your opponent on the field, thrashing them with your fist seems kind of pointless. And, there’s another upside. Little Tammy Thompson won’t have the strength to beat-up anyone if she’s spent all day kicking a ball.”
OPTION-4: “The obvious solution has been overlooked,” states another parent, programmer Sherlock ‘Chips’ Wei, who has spent his whole life trying to blend in. “Simply dye everyone’s hair the same colour when they start school. You don’t know what it’s like, Leader. The beating of the drums would start, and then the remorseless chanting, and all the teachers would lock themselves in the staffroom until it was over. To protect children from their playmates’ scorn and savagery, uniformity <i>is</i> the only way.” Paxton Harker’s parent trips him up, and a group of brunette parents guffaw.
