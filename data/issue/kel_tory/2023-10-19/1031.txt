TEXT:The literary world has been up in arms since the Strandbeast Prize, the most prestigious award for writing, was awarded to Kel Toryian rock star Dylan Roberts. This controversial honour has caused many to reconsider how literature should be taught in schools. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This is a disgrace to the arts,” remarks professor Daisy Green, while taking a break from violently crossing out entire paragraphs from a pile of essays she is grading. “It is preposterous that a prestigious award should go to such an undeserving person. His lyrics, which contain improper grammar, slang and profanities, should not be taught in schools. Only proper literature - novels, essays and poems - should be considered appropriate material for the curriculum. The education system must encourage children to read books and poems, not listen to ‘pop’ music.”
OPTION-1: “What?” says teenager Ivan Mumford, while taking off his headphones. “Oh yeah, Dylan Roberts is totally cool. He’s, like, inspiring too. Last night, he inspired me to write a song. It’s called ‘Like a Tumbling Boulder’; wanna hear it?” Looking disappointed by his would-be audience’s insistence on not hearing the song, he resumes. “We should definitely learn more about rock sta... I mean, song lyrics in schools. Songs are like poems, except way less boring.”
OPTION-2: “Have you heard some of these songs?” questions Moiraine Taylor, your Minister of Education. “Many of Dylan Roberts’ songs express anti-government themes and encourage the youth of Kel Tory to do illegal things. We cannot allow these messages to exist any more. The government must take control of the music industry, censor anything that encourages illegal activity, and punish those who flout the law.”
