TEXT:A survey recently released by the Kel Tory Housing Authority indicates that the country’s burgeoning population is rapidly leading to a housing crisis as families find themselves crammed into increasingly cramped living spaces. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “What we need are more high rises, whether low-cost or fancy condos,” says demographic expert Luke Tarkin. “They’re efficient, waste little land, and wouldn’t you love to wake up to the bright cheery sky in front of you every morning? Of course, there’s the problem of higher contagious disease transmission, but I’m sure our health system is robust enough for that. Not to mention all the jobs these new buildings will bring.”
OPTION-1: “All these industrial factories take up so much space,” argues social welfare commentator Sabrina Chapman. “The fact is, not only do they pollute, but they hog land that is better used for low-cost housing. Studies show that apartments are just too cramped for people to be comfortable in. We would be a lot better off in simple single-floor houses. Especially if they’re subsidised by the government.”
OPTION-2: “This raises an interesting issue,” says Amelia Hume, staunch supporter of birth control. “And that is: why do we need to build more housing anyway? Why don’t we just limit the number of children each family can have? Besides, pregnancy causes all sorts of complications. We’re better off with less of it anyway.”
