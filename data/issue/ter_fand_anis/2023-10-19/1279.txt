TEXT:Officials from the tiny, allied nation of Prudenlund have requested that Ter Fand Anis assist in a series of humanitarian aid airdrops to one of its distant territories. The target for the drops — a chain of sparsely-inhabited islands recently ravaged by storms — has been difficult for Prudenlundian authorities to reach, as their nation lacks sufficient transport assets. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “We have everything ready to go, just nothing for all of it to go in,” moans the Prudenlundian Ambassador to Ter Fand Anis. “The island chain is too distant for our smaller aircraft, and sea delivery will take too long. That’s why we’d appreciate it if our friends in Ter Fand Anis could spare a few military transport aircraft, and carry out the drops for us. We only really need the planes, but if Ter Fand Anis would like to provide additional supplies to drop, soap or unwanted clothes or something, that’d be great too.”
OPTION-1: “Look man, I’d be down with sendin’ a couple planes or somethin’, but y’all Prudenlund people obviously havent brought any gas money,” says a young, brutally frugal official from the finance ministry’s Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Excellence division. “And since y’all don’t have gas money, it’s gotta be a no on this whole airdrop thing. Ditto for all our other expensive and wasteful aid commitments elsewhere. Tell ya what though, I’ll drop a line to the World Assembly or somethin’, ask them to help out instead. Y’all got phone money?”
OPTION-2: “Isn’t that island chain famous for its coffee plantations?” muses your Minister for Agriculture. “You know, they’re actually direct competitors in coffee exports, and the low strength of their currency is giving them a disproportionate market share. I suggest we deliver the aid, but contaminate the crates with fungus spores, to subtly sabotage their coffee production. We’ll look like we’re helping while covertly establishing a competitive advantage.”
