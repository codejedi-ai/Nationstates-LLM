TEXT:A local brewery provided the Mayor of Labtop City with 120 free kegs of their famous ale: Smith’s Blood — usually a year’s supply — as has been the tradition for many years. However, the current mayor has consumed the lot in just two months and taxpayers are now being asked to replenish the provision. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “I know this makes me look like a drunk, but I assure you I’m not,” pleads Mayor Bonaparte, as she touches her nose with her finger to prove her point. “I host a lot of diplomatic parties and my guests expect a certain level of hospitality. Just last week, I was hosting the Smalltopian ambassador and his entourage, and those Smalltopians can drink! You must replenish the mayoral supply — think of the diplomatic embarrassment of dry events.”
OPTION-1: “We have to pay for their booze now?” questions Sandra Haggard, a social activist, who is always scrutinising politicians’ expenses. “What if she drinks the whole lot in another two months? Will the suffering taxpayer have to continue to fund Her Worship’s excesses? If politicians can’t go five minutes without a drink, then they’re not fit for office. Ban all alcohol on government premises.”
OPTION-2: “Our Smith’s Blood is probably the finest brew in all of Ter Fand Anis,” interjects Ami Normous, the Head Taster at the brewery, as she takes a sip from your drink, then spits it back into the cup. “It’s a pity that only this mayor gets to taste our tantalising tipple, and for free too! We could supply your office terry, and even the whole of parliament. All we ask in return is that you could meet with some of the industry bosses occasionally and give us a favourable hearing.”
OPTION-4: “I have an idea,” interjects a hobo, who’s been listening in on your conversation from the bench outside your window. “Why doesn’t the government provide free booze for everyone? That would be nice.”
