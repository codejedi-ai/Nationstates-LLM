TEXT:The local inhabitants in one of the far-flung colonies of Darcyus have been protesting about the occupation and their calls for independence have been growing louder. Your secretary has suggested that you take a vacation to this land in the hope that you can resolve this dispute and enjoy some ‘me-time’ in between mediation. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “You cannot allow this occupation to continue!” cries native activist Chiri Usman over the chanting locals. “Our island was illegally seized by your government. Your military continues to fire shells on practice ranges on our land and deny us access to sacred sites in the name of ‘national defense’! Not only that, but also native Darkites are moving into homes over here and forcing us off our ancestral domains. So please, New - Darcy, leave this island and restore our once proud kingdom.”
OPTION-1: “What do these savages know about running a country?” asks Rear Admiral Cobblepot, as military police in pith hats push the crowd back. “When we annexed this island, it was nothing but a rock in the sea getting by on fish and fruit. We have brought civilization and protection to these people! Plus, don’t forget that this island is paramount in securing our control of the surrounding seas — are the concerns of a few rowdy locals worth endangering the safety of our families back home? Increase the military presence here, so when the locals call us ‘Boss’... they mean it!”
OPTION-2: “Now, now, what’s happened has happened,” chimes in Governor Jones. “However, we do have to consider everyone’s feelings. Families from the mainland now live here and, without government support, this island would struggle to keep basic services running. Instead, you could just give more autonomy to this place, and other territories like it. The military can stay, but we should be able to pass our own laws that also reflect the needs of the local people.”
