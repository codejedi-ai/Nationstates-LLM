TEXT:After the recent Syrupgate Scandal (where your niece was seen eating pancakes with a non-maple-based sweetener) relations between Brancaland and Chavoldosperbien have reached an all-time low. Hoping to patch things over, a formal head of state visit has been arranged. On the itinerary is an open-top ride through their national park in a traditional moose-drawn carriage. However, security staff have expressed some concerns about this. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Have you heard of the Sons of the Maple?” asks your security chief, nervously checking behind your desk for hidden assassins. “They’re hard-line Brancalanders who haven’t forgiven Syrupgate and they’ve promised to throw a bucket of syrup over your head. Look, someone as important as you is always going to have enemies, and security is paramount. You should travel only in our own armoured vehicles, and have your safety provided only by our own security services. It’s a dangerous world  you have to be pragmatic.”
OPTION-1: “According to the World Census, Brancaland is in the top 5% safest nations in the world,” reassures your Minister for Diplomacy, who is known to be quite ambitious. “You’re as safe within their borders as you are within your own front room. We should show some trust in Brancalandian security arrangements. After that, I think we could boost your international standing if you visited the front lines of war-torn Maxtopia and try to bring some healing to that broken nation.”
OPTION-2: “When are you going to learn there’s no place that’s as safe as home?” queries your Minister of Domestic Affairs. “Besides, we’ve got problems enough here for you to deal with. You should cancel all state visits for the foreseeable future, and pledge to remain in Chavoldosperbien, putting your safety as well as the needs of Chavoldosperbienians first.”
