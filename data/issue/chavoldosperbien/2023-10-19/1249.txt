TEXT:High-ranking state official Magnus Brewer recently invested a lot of money into a multi-million Galactic Credits information technology company operating out of the United Federation, a notoriously capitalistic and wealthy nation. Varying socialists and revolutionaries are stating that this is a clear example of capitalist corruption within Chavoldosperbien. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Since when is it a bad thing,” ponders Brewer, “to make some business connections?” He pets the spotted feline curling up against him. “When in the Federation, do as the Federals do. It’s in the best interests of Chavoldosperbien to foster camaraderie with our overseas allies. After all, it doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice.”
OPTION-1: “You, Leader, are too great to allow these bourgeois pigs to corrupt our magnificent socialist nation,” screams your biggest fan, barging into your office uninvited for the third time this week. “Chavoldosperbienians put their trust in you to eliminate all of these enemies of the state and people! You must wield supreme control and oversight of all officials, in all branches, eliminating all who oppose you, your benevolent rule, and your beautiful nation! No one should invest in anything other than your rule.”
OPTION-2: “This shows that our state has been deeply corrupted from the inside!” monotonously chant ten students clad in red bandanas who have suddenly run into your office. Their leader continues, “Socialism is about the rule of the workers, the common people, the proletariat! All who have any ties to bourgeois-reactionary groups must be disenfranchised and violently removed from power. We, the Red Guards of Chavoldosperbien, will ensure that every Chavoldosperbienian is armed, revolutionary, and educated enough to understand how capitalist culture has stained even the most revolutionary of states. It is time to commence a Cultural Revolution!”
