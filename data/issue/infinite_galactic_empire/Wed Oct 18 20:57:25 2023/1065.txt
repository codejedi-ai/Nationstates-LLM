TEXT:Several nations that are party to the international climate treaty have been falling short of the treaty’s set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A few nations have even decided to withdraw from the agreement, leaving many worried about the future of the treaty and the planet. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Did they really just pull out and leave us?” histrionically shrieks Colin Tin, one of your country’s biggest advocates for signing the climate agreement. “We must not be impotent; we need to compensate for the rest of the world’s dangerous, lazy indifference. We need to significantly increase our ecological protection funding while also trying harder to decimate carbon emissions. It’ll all be worth it in the end when our nation isn’t under the sea.”
OPTION-1: “We can’t just take this lying down. We’ve gotta give those no-good double-crossers what they’re asking for  death and destruction!” fumes Ivanka Chew, a radical environmentalist obsessed with guns and big bazookas. “Show them their economies really will suffer by convincing our fellow signatories to put trade sanctions on any nation that chooses to withdraw. If they still don’t comply, we’ll wage a whippin’ war against them. Then we can whip our more negligent partners into shape as well. Hey, they consented to it; they signed the treaty.”
OPTION-3: “So, you want to help our planet by bombing other countries?” mockingly interrogates Catherine Gratwick, recent victor of the Annual Coruscant Dance-Off. “Forcing nations back into the agreement won’t help; in fact, they may be on to something here. If our treaty partners can’t keep up with the pace, we might need to take things slow and propose a reduction in treaty obligations to the other member states. Communication is key in a relationship, and it will certainly stop our friends from pulling out in the future.”
OPTION-4: “Or, maybe ya should just forget about this here nonsense ‘cuz it’s junk anyhoo,” rants an ambassador from the United Federation, thrusting a two-foot-long, fried, bacon-wrapped Mega Hot Dog Deluxe Supreme into his ten-gallon mug of Moonbucks coffee. “Even if clahmate changes were really caused by men, stahfling economical progress will only tarnish yer abilities to fahnd betta ways of doin’ thangs. If you quickly pull out now and denounce this here treaty for the Dàguó hoax it is, you will sure be much better off  just lahk us!”
