TEXT:Anarchists have been covertly putting up anti-government posters all over Infinite Galactic Empire. Some of your closest advisors have suggested the implementation of a secret police force to deal with the more... difficult members of society. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Sometimes a government has got to deal with something without having to go through the ‘proper channels’,” says ‘Diego’, who does not exist within any government records. “It happens sometimes and we have to deal with it. It’s not just anarchists either - it’s the terrorists, the criminals, the traitors, and the goddamn hippies. With a secret police we can arrest the troublemakers and torture them to find other dissenters without having to worry about fiddly matters like human rights.”
OPTION-1: “Don’t listen to that idiot!” whispers Jyn Grieg, one of your more guilt-ridden henchpersons. “I don’t know how you feel about this but I think this would be a bad path for our government to go down. Infinite Galactic Empire shouldn’t resort to deceit and off-the-record brutality to put away people. A secret police force would ruin our fine nation. It’s time our government was candid with its people and let them say what they want!”
OPTION-2: “Or how about we be candid AND have a secret police force,” says Oberon Murdoch, your head spy from behind a newspaper with eyeholes cut out. “We could just reassign all the normal police into secret police. The beauty of it is that we won’t have to bother solving crimes if it doesn’t benefit the government! It’s what we’ve always wanted! Not what the people want of course, but if they complain we can just make them... disappear.”
