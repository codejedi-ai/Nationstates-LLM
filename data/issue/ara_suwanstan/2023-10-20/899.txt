TEXT:Qraft of Ara Suwanstan, the largest dairy corporation in the nation, is facing grating criticism in the form of letters and protests involving blue cheese stink bombs. The denunciation of the company comes from independent rural cheesemakers angered over the production of individually wrapped slices of processed cheese, or singles. Cheese traditionalists, dairy dons, and queso collectivists have intruded on your peaceful lunch at the Cooperate Ziggurat Deli to make their voices heard over the sounds of the mechanical slicing of cheese. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Zese vile Ara Suwanstanian corporations are appropriating ze label of cheese, as if le plastique is authentique!” laments the passionate and flamboyant Vincent Fromage, Brancaland’s famous cheese connoisseur, as he smears moose brie on a slice of toasted bread. “Zese bland mockeries of real cheese are a disgrace to this nation’s cheesemaking heritage. Ze corporations should be restricted from calling zese glorified napkins ‘cheese’ and save that label for propeur products like Brancaland’s wondeurful blocks and roulettes, or Smalltopian Muenster, or...” He stops to clean breadcrumbs off his flashy suit.
OPTION-1: “That’s not enough to stop FAKE CHEESE! My comrade is merely a petty bourgeois puppet for the Ara Suwanstanian Chiefs of Cheddar,” exclaims Karl Engels Bryndza, a notorious Brancalandian social and economic reformer and part time milk-sourer, as he consumes a grilled Cooperate Ziggurat Jack sandwich. “REAL cheese traditionalists are tired of the oppression systematically imposed by dairy corporations. I say it’s time for us, the real cheesemakers, to take control! Seizing the means of production if you will. We will strip away the tyranny of those corrupt corporations like Qraft!”
OPTION-2: A large figure emerges from the shadows of the deli’s backroom. “Alas, only when it comes to cheese do these Marxists seem to care about our culture,” sighs the immense silhouette of Qraft’s CEO, known only as The Big Cheese. “These uneducated peasants always threaten to regulate industry, or even seize control of the nations companies. My company has every right to call our processed singles ‘cheese,’ even if they happen to be wobbly slices of soured milk, orange coloring, and emulsifiers. You dont expect citizens to buy ‘individually-wrapped cheese product’ or ‘pre-sliced cheese substitute,’ do you?”
OPTION-3: “What a bunch of radical lunatics!” remarks Gillian Hanover, mayor of a dairy village in the Ara Suwanstanian countryside. “Biggie Cheese over here and that Karl Angle character are using a topic as trivial as the production of cheese to increase their power and influence. However, Mister Cheese was right about leaving the processed cheese industry alone.” She eats a cube of smelly Greedy Pig cheese with a toothpick. “Many of these bumpkins, I mean craftsmen, live in poverty. Giving them a little assistance would satisfy the blessed cheesemakers, and ensure that they stick to making authentic Ara Suwanstanian cheese rather than intervene with the productivity of our processed cheese single factories.”
