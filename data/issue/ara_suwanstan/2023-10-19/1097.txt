TEXT:The Ara Suwanstanian navy has always allowed shore leave when docked at ports in the tiny allied nation of Prudenlund. However, after a brawl involving two hundred rowdy Ara Suwanstanian sailors in Prudenlund’s quiet city streets made international news, the admiralty has begun exploring ways to repair its image. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This... this is disgraceful!” states red-faced Rear Admiral Dunn. “These sailors are acting like common hooligans! I say we round them up, court martial the ringleaders and forbid all shore leave for the foreseeable future. Our reputation is at stake here.”
OPTION-1: “It’s not shore leave that’s the problem here, it’s the devil’s nectar!” notes dour-faced Warrant Officer Lincoln. “Let our sailors have their shore leave, but forbid them from drinking. We’ll just breathalyze them on their way back to the ship. As for any that fail... well, we can always break the old cat o’ nine tails out of the naval history museum.”
OPTION-2: “A drop of Sestero’s Blood never done us any harm!” chants Bosun’s Mate Barrow, swaying slightly from side to side. “Getting hamm... er, drinking on shore leave is a sailor’s right from time immemorial! Those stuck up Prudenlundians wouldn’t know a good time if it smacked them round the head with a bottle! If they’re so opposed to our lot enjoying themselves - then our ships should just avoid their ports and maybe we should stop trading with them too. That’ll learn’em!”
OPTION-3: “Now... now wait here just a minute...” slurs a queasy cadet who appears to have gatecrashed the meeting. “I’ve been talking to my mates, right... and we don’t wanna be in the navy any more. We might have to kill people and that’s kind of a downer... but on the bright side, we throw the best parties! Say, that’s a thought - let’s get rid of the whole navy nonsense and open up our warships for party cruises!”
