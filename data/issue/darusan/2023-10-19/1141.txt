TEXT:After the public poll to name Temple Of will’s newest trolley line was handily won by a tired and insincere meme response, making it the sixth consecutive poll with similar results, the mayor has come to your office begging for an official stance on naming procedures for public projects. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “Trolley McTrolleyface?” sighs the mayor dejectedly. “I have to ride to work on Trolley McTrolleyface? I wanted ‘The Ashla Express,’ but no, we’re stuck with this boring nonsense again. Instead of throwing open these polls to every juvenile delinquent or obnoxious ‘Grick and Morgy’ fan, could we please establish some boundaries? How about a committee of respected citizens to vet the choices that are on the ballot? That way the people get their say, and we get some dignity!”
OPTION-1: “Remind me again why we let the public vote on this stuff at all,” interjects your Auxiliary Regional Subaltern for Naming Things. “The government foots the bill, the government has the responsibility for maintaining our nation’s image, and the government should choose the name! Heck, perhaps you should just name the next project after yourself!”
OPTION-2: “Are you kidding me? These names are great!” bubbles Abraham Bell, your Communication Director’s intern, while excitedly checking your metrics. “This isn’t civic failing, it’s civic engagement! If some silly names are all it takes to get citizens fired up and interested in public works, then isn’t that worth it? Who cares if it’s a bit repetitious  it’s great for our optics! Besides, if we really are a democracy, we have to respect the people’s vote.”
