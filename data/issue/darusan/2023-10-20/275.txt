TEXT:State department officials are in an uproar over the leaking of key government cables by the website <i>WikiSpills</i>. The site’s owner, under the nom de plume “El Denunciante,” is operating from an anonymous location in neighboring Bigtopia, where the government can’t reach him. Darusan’s leaders are sharply divided on how to respond. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “This man has done no wrong!” says Alan O'Leary, who also happens to be the head writer of <i>The Temple Of Will Times Magazine</i>. “The people have a right to transparency of government. El Denunciante is a hero who has revolutionized my magazine sale - er -Freedom of Speech for this country. No state action must be committed that would infringe upon our right to disclose government information, regardless of the effects on diplomatic relations. Besides, it isn’t as though you’ve got anything to hide... do you?”
OPTION-1: “El Denunciante is a terrorist and has committed treason,” argues reactionary talk radio host Dixie Vasquez. “The fact is, he has consistently presented an anti-Darusan agenda, and people like him need to be stopped from propagandizing their filth. What we need is to block this website and any others which threaten the security of this great nation. Like those opposition party blogs that keep popping up! I mean, what use is personal freedom if you don’t have security and peace of mind?”
OPTION-2: “This seems like a lot of needless work, if you ask me,” says Pericles, your brother-in-law, while enjoying a foul-smelling beverage in your office. “Why should the people get to discuss you and your government anyway? Seems to me things would be much easier if you just told them what their opinion was and blocked out all others. After all, who knows what’s best for them better than you, am I right? Cheers!”
