TEXT:An unlikely alliance of risque comedians and baby boomers has barged into your office, annoyed about how easily young people get offended these days. 
OPTIONS: 
OPTION-1: “What these immature juveniles need is good ol’ discipline!” says retired army Major Harper, known by his neighbors as ‘The Major’. “Back in the day we didn’t have the time to be offended by everything and anything; we were too busy fighting for the Holy Republic. Conscript these fruitcakes; the military will set them straight.”
OPTION-2: “Why did the chicken cross the road?” asks famous comedian Violet O'Leary, as she reveals a punchline to your staff that elicits more shocks than laughs. “Look, I’m just trying to make a living here. Do you know how difficult it is when these kids are posting how insensitive my jokes are all over social media? Artists like myself should not have their careers destroyed just because some college students can’t appreciate a good joke when they hear one. We should ban the internet and save ourselves from the comments section!”
OPTION-3: “STOP MICRO-AGGRESSIONS!” yells Chloe Vasquez, not looking at you as she types intently on her cell phone. “Young people like myself understand how language is only a social construct to keep the oppressed subjugated, but the old ones don’t. It is high time people like these two fossils stop benefiting from the misery of this nation’s downtrodden. Sensitivity training should be mandatory for all people over 40.”
OPTION-4: “It doesn’t have to be either way,” says your Secretary of Solutions, Hercules Connery, as he takes away the phone from the teen, puts duct tape over the mouth of the comedian, and formally discharges the major. “What we need is a government-approved words and phrases list. That way kids won’t be offended and comics can still make their jokes. It’s a win-win! Well, except for freedom of speech, but that’s not the issue here, is it?”
