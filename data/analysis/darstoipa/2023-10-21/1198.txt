ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: Requiring bodies to be disposed of within a week ensures that public health safety is maintained. According to our constitution, the right to safety and well-being of others is strongly emphasized and any practice that threatens this principle is unacceptable. The proposal also aligns with our policy goals of maintaining high public health standards, minimizing risks to the safety and prosperity of our citizens. This decision does not infringe upon individual liberties as it is based on health concerns, governed by evidence and rational consideration.

Rejected options:

OPTION-1: While it respects the rights of individuals to express their grief in their own way, it potentially compromises public health. Our constitution emphasizes the importance of safeguarding the well-being of our society, and a practice that potentially threatens public health contradicts this principle. 

OPTION-2: This suggestion introduces a middle-ground method of dealing with a deceased body, but it could create new ethical and moral concerns. It might not align with the cultural and religious sensibilities of individuals, and thus may contradict our commitment to respect diversity and individual freedoms. Also, spending public funds on such an enterprise would not align with our policy goals of economic efficiency and responsible resource management.
