ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Psychiatrist Pax Holst provides an understanding and considerate approach to address this issue. The mental well-being of an individual, even one who exhibits antisocial behavior such as stalking, is paramount in our nation. We have to consider the constitution's firm stance on protecting individual rights (as stated in Article I: Civil Rights). Hence, implementing therapeutic assistance aligns with our constitution's intent. Making stalking a serious offense does not contradict our principles, and using therapeutic intervention for normalization seems socially and ethically appropriate. We can balance the influence between maintaining public safety and ensuring psychological well-being by modifying this approach to include legal consequences for repeated offenders, which aligns with the principle of upholding civil rights without discrimination.

Rejected Options:
OPTION-0: While it is true that a strict stance is required to discourage stalking and protect the privacy and tranquility of citizens, imprisoning individuals without attempting rehabilitation or addressing the root of their behavior seems harsh and inconsiderate of possible mental health issues.

OPTION-3: This is a clear violation of individual freedoms and privacy, directly in conflict with Article I: Civil Rights and Article III: Technological Advancement of our constitution. Stalking is not the right way to handle breakups and something this invasive would cause fear and distress among our citizens. Also, death threats are seriously condemned by our constitution and engaging in such behavior is punishable by law. This option presents significant risks to the personal safety of others and the stability of our society.
