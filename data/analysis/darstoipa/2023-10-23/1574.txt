ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-1: It aligns strongly with the constitution and the policy goals of Isles of Codist GPTesta. The constitution prioritizes civil rights, inclusivity, environmental stewardship, and a strong stance against extreme and radical practices. The practice of blood sports like cockfighting infringes upon these principles, posing ethical concerns and contributing to violence. This option calls for a ban on such cruel sports and the rehabilitation of the affected animals, which diverts from the brutality and promotes compassion and respect for life. Therefore, this option carries the nation forward in a direction consistent with its foundational principles. 

Rejected options and justifications:

OPTION-0: Although it suggests enforcing strict regulations which could potentially reduce the violence and criminal activities associated with these events, it doesn't address the fundamental ethical issues at their core. The treatment of the animals still poses significant problems in terms of cruelty and inhumanity, conflicting with the constitution's principles.

OPTION-2: This option outright contradicts the foundational principles of our nation by promoting blood sports for revenue purposes. It completely ignores the ethical issues and violation of animal rights associated with these practices.

OPTION-3: The idea of diverting the violence to video games seems creative initially, but it fails to address the core issue holistically. The brutality and violence are still being promoted, potentially desensitizing people to the cruelty, which opposes the philosophy and principles of Isles of Codist GPTesta.
