ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-0: Dorothy and her family are campaigning for a “Dying with Dignity” bill, to change this situation. She implores the government to legalize euthanasia. This aligns with the principles laid out in our constitution, which prioritizes civil rights and the well-being of individuals. It is consistent with the understanding that everyone should have control over their own life, including making decisions about their end of life care. Given the situation that Dorothy is in, suffering from end-stage cancer, it seems only reasonable and compassionate that she should be allowed to end her struggle against death.

The rejected option is OPTION-1: “I understand this is a very difficult time for these people,” says freelance medical writer Iago Peters. “But the solution is not to let our medical system slide down the slippery slope of killing people in pain. We must cure, not kill. This is not the right time for euthanasia.” This option was rejected because it clashes with the constitution's mandate to respect individual rights, particularly when considering someone's personal desire to avoid suffering. The prevention of unnecessary suffering is a core principle of our constitution, which this recommendation negates.

Also rejected is OPTION-2: “I agree, but go further: there is never a right time for euthanasia,” says Bishop Michonne Webster. “The lives we lead are given to us by the grace of God, and he decides when they end. It is not for us to question God’s divine purpose, no matter how odd or screwed-up it may seem.” This option was rejected due to the prohibition of extreme religious practices in our constitution. It imposes a religious perspective onto a decision that fundamentally resides with each individual and their personal beliefs. Clearly, our society relies on balanced reasoning in decision-making processes, which this option fails to provide.
