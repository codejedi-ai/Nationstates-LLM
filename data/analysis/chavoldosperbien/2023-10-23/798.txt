ANALYSIS:
Option-1 is the best course of action. Elaine Assange's recommendation to name the element "Unseptnineteenbillionium" adheres to recognized international standards and regulations when it comes to naming new elements. This is particularly important from both a professional and scientific accuracy standpoint, ensuring clarity and uniformity in scientific communications globally. 
Justification: Scientific advancement is a core principle of our nation, and following international scientific standards underlines this commitment. Allowing a more whimsical or self-centered approach to naming could undermine the scientific community's perception of our nation. 
In light of our constitution and principles, this option best aligns with respect for professional standards in scientific discovery and dissemination. 

Option-0 is rejected because science should be an objective field free from personal bias. Naming the element after Algernon Sandler undermines this objectivity and could set a dangerous precedent for future discoveries where personal egos might overshadow the value of the discovery itself.
Option-2 is rejected because it misuses science for political promotion. Naming the element after a political leader is inconsistent with the principles of our nation, which promotes scientific advancement rather than political individualism. The proposal to name every element after national leaders is even more problematic, as it would create massive confusion and goes against international scientific norms.
Option-3 is rejected because it undermines professional scientific practices. Naming elements based on their properties is not always practical because properties might be shared between elements. This could lead to confusion and complexity in scientific communication.
