ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: The nation of Isles of Codist GPTesta values intelligence, scientific advancement, and information technology among its top priorities. Thus, the approach of conducting surveys to understand the desired policies of citizens aligns well with our nation's ethos of data-driven decision-making. Moreover, it allows our nation's leadership to select the most qualified experts to implement policies, further supporting our values of meritocracy and the pursuit of excellence. Essentially, the recommendations made by citizens would be evaluated and acted upon by professionals in the field, reaffirming our commitment to expert guidance and the efficient use of technology.

Why are the other options rejected?
OPTION-0: Although the expression of individuality is important, it might dilute the seriousness of the electoral process. Candidates may focus more on publicity stunts than deliberating on critical issues, which goes against our nation's focus on intelligence and serious debate.

OPTION-1: While Lisbeth Burrow's idea emphasizes issue-based campaigns, it does not provide a concrete solution for the current issue in hand. Further, the idea of better oversight is vague without concrete steps towards how this is to be accomplished.

OPTION-3: This option suggests a complete abolition of democracy and the appointment of Steve Dannon without any substantive reason or clear judicial process. This proposal contradicts our nation's principles of civil rights, political freedoms, and the fair application of power. It might lead to autocracy and potentially infringe upon the constitution's directives.
