ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: Containing the spread of the fungus would align with our nation's principles and goals of preserving environmental beauty and practicing responsible resource management. By enclosing the infected section of the park with a glass bio-dome, we can prevent further damage to our local woodland. Additionally, this option respects our diplomatic ties with Brancaland, aligning with our commitment to inclusivity and open society. 

Here is the modus ponens: 
Premise 1: If a foreign entity threatens our environment or biodiversity, it must be contained to prevent further harm (according to our principles of environmental beauty and responsible resource management). 
Premise 2: The parasitic fungus from Brancaland is spreading and ravaging our local woodland. 
Conclusion: Therefore, we must contain the parasitic fungus to prevent further harm.

Reasons for rejecting other options:

OPTION-1: While it is essential to protect our environment, this option advocates for a drastic and potentially harmful response that could disrupt our ecosystem and have unintended consequences. The use of flamethrowers could harm other organisms and damage the soil. 

OPTION-2: Engaging in biological warfare against Brancaland would not align with our principles of diplomacy, respect for other nations, and environmental stewardship. This action could potentially strain our relationship with Brancaland and other nations, and may cause extensive environmental damage in Brancaland.

OPTION-3: Deliberately spreading the fungus to every forest in our nation goes against our goals of preserving environmental beauty and practicing responsible resource management. The potential harm to our ecosystems from this invasive species could be significant and irreversible.
