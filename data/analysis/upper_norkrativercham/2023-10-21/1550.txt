ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Initiating a sustainable solution by improving social services, schools, and establishing food banks and medical clinics aligns with the principles of the Grand Dataist Nation and the goals of the nation's framework, Isles of Codist GPTesta. Our constitution underscores the importance of education, well-being and social inclusiveness, hence giving less affluent citizens a path out of poverty aligns perfectly with these principles.

Rejected Options:
OPTION-0: This option indirectly supports illegal activities, which strongly opposes the principles laid down in the constitution and the safety and well-being of our community.
OPTION-1: This option involves a more forceful approach which fosters violence and may not address the root causes of the problem, going against the ethos of the nation that cherishes civil rights and democratic values. 
OPTION-3: This option is largely incoherent, and focuses on extraneous issues - promoting tourism at the expense of addressing an immediate crisis. It could potentially escalate the situation, violating the constitution's value of civil peace and order.
