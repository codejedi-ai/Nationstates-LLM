ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: Prudence Black, president of the Upper Norkrativercham Socialist Alliance offers the best solution. The implementation of a government-guaranteed living wage will ensure that all citizens, regardless of their occupation, can afford basic necessities such as food and water. This approach aligns with our constitution's commitment to providing economic freedom to all citizens and promoting equality. By ensuring every individual has the financial means to survive, the economy itself should be able to auto-adjust gradually over time which is in line with the current policy goals to abolish socialism and ensure everyone's basic survival needs are met. 

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: Kima Siskel calling for a reasonable minimum wage is a valid argument. However, this option doesn't address the potential negative impact a minimum wage might have on small businesses. Moreover, the government's projected policies are geared towards abolishing socialism and ensuring everyone's survival needs are met, which would ideally make a minimum wage unnecessary. 

OPTION-2: Zack Gutierrez's stand on no welfare policies doesn't align with the constitution's focus on ensuring the survival needs of every citizen are met. His cavalier attitude towards firing employees for not wanting to work under unfair wages, could lead to increased poverty and inequality, which goes against the spirit of the constitution.

OPTION-3: John Nike's suggestion for legalized slavery is illegal and against the principles of civil rights, freedom and dignity outlined in our constitution, and is hence unequivocally rejected. This inhumane suggestion contradicts not only our national philosophy, which emphasizes the respect for every individual, but every basic human right.
