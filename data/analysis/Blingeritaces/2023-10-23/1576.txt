ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-0: Paris Kane's proposal to replace outdated security measures with advanced detection technology ensures a seamless passenger experience without compromising on safety. If we consider our nation's commitment to technological innovation and scientific advancement, this aligns perfectly with our goals and principles. Using machine learning for threat analysis and implementing CT luggage scanners will improve security efficiency and reduce unnecessary restrictions, like the liquid ban.

The rejected options are:

OPTION-1: Wolfgang Reagan's viewpoint is contradictory to our nation's effort to foster a harmonious and compassionate society. While security is critical, instilling fear in citizens and infringing on their freedom under the guise of safety contradicts our constitutional principles. 

OPTION-2: The suggestion from your brother to make an exception for water is a simplistic solution to a complex problem. While it might seem intuitive, it would be difficult to implement in practice and could potentially expose us to security vulnerabilities.

OPTION-3: Cleveland Yates' proposal goes against our nation's commitment to civil rights and liberties. Severely restricting carry-on luggage and forcing passengers to purchase water at marked-up prices not only inconveniences passengers, but also may be seen as an attempt to profit from a security measure. This could result in public backlash and damage our commitment to transparency and fairness.
