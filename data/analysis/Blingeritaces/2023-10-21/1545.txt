ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: The best option is to protect these war graves in accordance with the overall goals and values of the nation's framework. These graves are remnants of historical events and should be treated with respect and dignity. The modus ponens here would be the news of the salvage operation, which is unacceptable under the constitution, goals, and ideas of the Grand Dataist Nation. With the invoked principles of respect for history, sanctity of life and adherence to respectful practices, it is important to ensure that the war graves are not further subjected to such distressing actions. 

Rejected options:

OPTION-1: Although preserving these artifacts in the National Maritime Museum would have historical significance, the archaeologist's approach raises ethical issues, such as disrespect towards the deceased, that defy the ethos of our constitution and goals. The character's questionable past actions demonstrate disregard for the responsible handling of these historical artifacts.

OPTION-2: While economic and scientific benefits are important, using salvaged war graves for business pursuits shows disrespect and callous disregard for the sanctity of life, contradicting our constitution, values, and ideas of reverence for human life and dignity.

OPTION-3: Encouraging active destruction of ships for salvage is a direct violation of our principles of responsible action, respect for life, and good governance. It opposes the constitution, our philosophy, and breaches our view towards preserving life and maintaining integrity.
