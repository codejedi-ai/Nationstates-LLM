ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-1: Prof. Catherine Gratwick’s assertion that “Learning should be done out of love, not duty. The study of the Arts has been a noble field for many centuries, and learning it is not as easy as you think. I’d rather die than live in a world where creativity is stifled. We should be encouraging young artists, writers, musicians - if only to strengthen Blingeritaces’s cultural reputation.” This recommendation is rooted in the Constitution's emphasis on the respect for individual liberties, the importance of cultural preservation, and the recognition of diversity and inclusivity. This approach aligns with the constitution's principles, particularly Articles I, II, VII and V that stress the importance of respecting individual rights, celebrating diversity, and preserving culture. Furthermore, it is in sync with the policy goal of education and human development index. 

Contrarily, OPTION-0: Thiago Yew's suggestion to only focus on "worthwhile and valuable subjects" neglects the constitutional commitment to cultural preservation, diversity, and education. It contradicts the ethos of diversity and the recognition of varying fields of study as valuable. This option also undermines the importance of arts and humanities in education, which is crucial for fostering a well-rounded, inclusive society. 

OPTION-2: Bharatendu English's idea for a heavily industrialized society allowing only a select few to pursue further education contradicts the principles in the constitution particularly Article V and Article I. It infringes upon the people’s right to education, and fails to consider the importance of variegated fields of study. This proposal would also lead to an unjust society not congruent with the constitution that seeks inclusivity and diversity.
