ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-1: Investing in preventing future incidents by widening and deepening the canal would help mitigate similar situations in the future. It aligns with the principles laid out in our constitution about high efficiency and responsible resource management. Major investments in infrastructure often result in significant long-term savings by reducing the likelihood and severity of costly incidents in the future. If we combine this with the news about recent calamities, the necessity of such a move becomes even more apparent.

The reason for rejecting OPTION-0 is that, while immediate action is necessary, it does not address the root cause of the problem. Solving the current crisis without preventing future ones does not align with the principles of efficient resource management laid out in our constitution.

The reason for rejecting OPTION-2 is that using artillery could cause significant and unnecessary damage, potentially exacerbating the problem. This choice would not only endanger lives, but also violate the ideas about environmental stewardship and the principles of civic respect outlined in our constitution. Furthermore, the current situation does not warrant such extreme measures.
