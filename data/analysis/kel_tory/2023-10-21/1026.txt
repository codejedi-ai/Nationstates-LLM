ANALYSIS:
The best option for us is OPTION-2 because it aligns with the goals, constitution, and ideas of Isles of Codist GPTesta. This option favors the use of globes in schools, which provides an unaltered depiction of the world devoid of man-made borders and political distortions. It encourages the education of children in a way that they see themselves as citizens of the planet instead of just one nation, which is in line with the constitution's emphasis on inclusivity, diversity, and education. According to the premises given in the constitution such as fostering an inclusive society, prioritizing education at all levels, and embracing a world view, and based on the policy goal of promoting information technology and scientific advancement, favoring globes in classrooms will help in achieving a better understanding of geography, international relations, and global issues. Hence, modus ponens, OPTION-2 is justified as the best choice.

However, the following options are to be rejected:

OPTION-0 promotes conformity to international standards, but it undermines the prominence of Isles of Codist GPTesta, contravening our goal of national unity and pride.

OPTION-1 proposes eliminating the Maxcator Projection, which would isolate us from international norms and risk our international relations, contradicting our inclusive and cooperative constitution and policy goals.

OPTION-3 puts the nation's interest to an extreme by cutting off from the world. This contradicts the constitution's articles on openness, inclusivity, educational advancement and promotes an insulated view, contradicting our dedication to globalization and broader understanding.
