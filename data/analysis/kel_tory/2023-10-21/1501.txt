ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0 is the best choice because the preservation of an endangered species should be a priority over the conversion of a golf course to a bogland. The presence of the Marche Noire Diamond-Backed Gopher, an endangered species, is significant and aligns with the Isles of Codist GPTesta's commitment to environmental stewardship, as stated in its constitution- Article IV. Furthermore, according to the news, the area was recently acquired and will not affect much of the existing land. This course of action also adheres to the current policy goals of environmental beauty and efficiency. 

As for the rejected options; 
OPTION-1 emphasizes restoring the bogland at the expense of the endangered Marche Noire Diamond-Backed Gopher's habitat. This contradicts the environmental principles of biodiversity preservation set out in our constitution and policy goals. 
OPTION-3 advocates loosening environmental regulations for personal convenience and short-sighted economic gains, which directly opposes Article IV of the constitution and the national commitment to protect native flora and fauna. It also disregards the nation's commitment to environmental sustainability and ethical decision-making, and compromises the health and safety of all citizens by introducing harmful toxins to the environment that may damage the overall ecosystem.
