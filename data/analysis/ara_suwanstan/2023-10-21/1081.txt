ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: To fund a compulsory statistical curriculum in schools that illuminates the nation on topics like selection bias and basic statistics. This aligns with our national goals to prioritize education, specifically in the spheres of science and technological advancement, and also adheres to the national philosophy; encouraging intelligence, scientific advancement, and employment, underpinned by principles of inclusivity, open, compassionate society, high technological base and a priority on education. 

The rejected options would be:
OPTION-0: This does not provide a viable solution and it could potentially infringe upon freedom of speech and expression. It also ignores the potential positive impact of a new attraction on the nation's economy, violating our goals of free-market capitalism and individual opportunity.
OPTION-2: This option would only serve to advance individual interests rather than prioritizing the well-being of the nation as a whole. It fails to address the need for education on the matter, deviating from the constitutional principles of fostering scientific advancement and prioritizing education.
