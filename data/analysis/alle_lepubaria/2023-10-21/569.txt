ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-4: The idea proposed by Ruri Hoshino, Director of Alle Lepubarian State Automotive Research. This alternative suggests hosting the World Sports Prototype Championship with round-the-clock endurance races at a state-funded stadium. This aligns with the nation's values of Scientific Advancement, Intelligence, Information Technology, and Environmental Beauty. Developing advanced automotive technology through sports car racing will push forward our national technological capabilities (modus ponens using the principle of Scientific Advancement). Additionally, the noise and air pollution laws are crucial for maintaining the Environmental Beauty of Isles of Codist GPTesta. Hence ebbing them for the sake of a race contradicts with our constitutional values and principles.

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: Alexis Lef√©vre's suggestion to construct a new top-end racing facility in the eastern swampland. Considering our stringent stance on Environmental Beauty and the recent news about a violent cult taking control of the government and instituting practices against the constitution, such construction could potentially destabilize our environment and shake the foundations of our constitutional order even further (modus ponens using current news and constitution).

OPTION-5: While Belinda Martin's idea of investing in equestrianism provides a nod to Environmental Beauty, it doesn't align with our goals of Intelligence, Scientific Advancement, and Information Technology. This traditional sport might not push the boundaries of technological innovation and advancement, as the proposition of OPTION-4 does (modus ponens using current news with national philosophy and values).
