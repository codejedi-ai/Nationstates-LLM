ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: The best option is to implement periodic driving test retakes for elderly residents from age sixty, as proposed by Xerxes Watts. This would allow the state to ensure that elderly drivers still hold the necessary skills and abilities to safely operate vehicles, maintaining public safety on our roads, which aligns with our constitutional commitment to the well-being of our citizens. It rejects the notions of confiscating rights from the elderly (as per our commitment to civil rights) and indiscriminately banning a wide age group from driving (which contradicts our policy of embracing diversity).

However...

OPTION-1: is rejected because, although it insists on preserving the rights of the elderly (which is in alignment with our commitment to inclusivity and civil rights), it overlooks the objective evidence of an escalating public safety issue due to elderly-related traffic accidents. The preservation of rights should not overrule public safety considerations. Hence, doing nothing to address this situation is not an option.

OPTION-2: is rejected because it calls for the blanket banning of anyone over the age of fifty from driving. This severely infringes upon civil liberties and goes against our commitment to diversity and inclusivity. While the idea is ostensibly to improve road safety, it indiscriminately targets a large segment of the population without consideration for individual competence or circumstance, hence it goes against the principles of fairness in our constitution.
