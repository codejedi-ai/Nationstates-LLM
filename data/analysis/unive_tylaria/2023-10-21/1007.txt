ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: The justification being that these suggestions align with the Grand Dataist Nation's values and principles, fostering more responsible behavior without infringing on dog owners' rights. This adjustment can improve cleanliness in public spaces and lessen instances of such discomforting incidents. Modus Ponens: The idea to increase the number of disposal facilities in public spaces aligns with the constitution's principles of high societal standards, cleanliness, and respect for public spaces.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: Merely imposing stricter regulations and higher penalties on dog owners could potentially infringe on their rights and does not offer a constructive solution to the problem. It's against our goal of economic freedom and the idea of free-market capitalism. It fails to address the root of the problem, that is, the lack of waste disposal facilities in public areas. 

OPTION-2: Discriminating against dog owners and promoting cat ownership instead fails to address the underlying issue. This suggestion also goes against our constitutional commitment to freedom of choice and diversity. It's against our nation's values to use tax money to promote one pet over another and doesn't solve the problem of pet waste in public spaces. It infringes civil rights by restricting the freedom of individuals to choose their preferred pets.
