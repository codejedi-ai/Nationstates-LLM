ANALYSIS:
OPTION-3: By adopting Dàguó’s one child policy, we can control the population growth while reducing the number of orphans in our nation. With the inclusion of tax incentives for those who adopt, we are providing our citizens an opportunity to be part of the solution. This choice is not only aligned with our principles laid out in the constitution, such as preferring adoption over exploitation of children but also with our goals including population control and ensuring the well-being of our children. 

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: Despite the plea of the orphan Minuscule Max, it is not sustainable to fund orphanages at the expense of other necessary areas like defense. This option doesn't provide a long-term solution to the issue of orphan overcrowding.

OPTION-1: Sending orphans to military training academies in exchange for our funding, while practical, contradicts our nation's goal of upholding civil rights and providing quality education for all our citizens. The militarization of orphans could detrimentally impact their welfare and development.

OPTION-2: Lowering the working age to enable orphans to work in factories not only clashes with our nation's principles concerning child welfare and protection but can possibly lead to exploitation. It doesn't present a balanced, fair solution to the problem and might result in a violation of child rights.
