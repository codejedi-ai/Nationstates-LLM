ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: Donating your lottery winnings to charity would alleviate the public outcry and shift the focus to the philanthropic actions. Given the nation's high values of civil rights and education, supporting charities that foster these values would reflect positively on the leader and align well with the nation's principles. Plus, it adheres to the constitution's emphasis on environmental stewardship and technological advancement.

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: Declaring this drawing void would be disruptive and could lead to additional public backlash, suggesting an inability of the leader to handle unexpected situations appropriately. 

OPTION-2: Handing off the winnings to a family member exhibits nepotism and could compromise the principles of fairness and accountability outlined in the constitution.

OPTION-3: While celebrating is a natural response, using the winnings for personal pleasure when the nation is evidently facing challenges could send the wrong message to the citizens in regards to the leader's priorities.

Modus Ponens:
Given that the recent lottery winnings have caused a public outcry, and given that the leader can alleviate this by making a philanthropic gesture aligned with the nation's values and constitution, the leader should donate the winnings to a relevant charity.
