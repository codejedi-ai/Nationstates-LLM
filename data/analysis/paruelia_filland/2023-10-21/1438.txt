ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: This option aligns with the nation's principles of freedom of assembly and expression, as outlined in our justice code. It ensures that people can exercise their rights without infringing on others' abilities to vote. By setting up special areas for demonstrations, it promotes a peaceful and fair election process as indicated in the constitution. It is a practical answer that promotes both civil rights and political freedom. 

Given that the constitution upholds freedom of assembly and the preservation of political freedom (Justice Code: Point 8), and given the recent news regarding the government's take over by a violent cult, setting up special areas for demonstrations some distance away from voting locations stays in line with the nation's values and mitigates potential violence and disruption to the election process. 

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: This option would give the 'Bikers for Leader' group disproportionate influence and could intimidate voters, contrary to our goals of preserving civil rights and political freedoms. It goes against Justice Code: Point 1 (the rule of law) and Point 9 (the right to freedom of association) because it elevates one group's rights at the expense of the collective.

OPTION-2: This option seems illogical and poorly defined. Investing in a call center in Bigtopia does not address the issue at hand and is irrelevant to the nation's policies and constitution. The implications of this choice on the nation's freedom and integrity aren't clearly outlined. Additionally, it ignores the nation's core value of intelligence and the policy goal of maintaining a high technological base. The proposal to handle the issue outside the nation also contradicts our policy goal of Autarky.
