ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: We must employ strategic and discerning judgment in handling Catherine Gratwick's endorsement. In accordance with the constitution's emphasis on respecting diverse perspectives, gratifying a range of constituents, and upholding dignity without fueling possible controversies is essential (Constitution, Articles II and IX). By playing it safe and seeing how it goes, we can monitor the responses accruing from her association without committing explicit endorsement. Sending her as a surrogate to events where this could be beneficial ties with the principles of Strategy and Utilizing Valuable Assets prevalent in the national philosophy of Sisu-Pura Vida.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: This choice contradicts the decorum expected of a national leader (Constitution, Preamble), disregards a large section's potentially adverse reactions, and risks alienating the moralists (Constitution, Article I).

OPTION-1: Outright denouncing Catherine Gratwick conflicts with the constitution's inclusivity ethos (Constitution, Article II). Additionally, it dismisses potential support from her large fanbase.

OPTION-3: While celebrating average voters is indeed crucial, discrediting Gratwick based on her profession contradicts the constitution's respect for diversity and undervalues the strategic potential her endorsement may provide (Constitution, Articles I and II).
