ANALYSIS:
OPTION-3: Calvin Colon provides a solution to this issue that satisfies most involved parties. This facilitates the needs of those who are sensitive to potentially allergenic scents while also acknowledging the freedom of those who wish to use fragrances. It doesn't necessitate a total ban on fragrances, which would infringe upon individual freedoms. This measure upholds the principles of individuality and freedom of choice, as expressed in the constitution of the Isles of Codist GPTesta, as well as the idea of celebrating diversity and ensuring the well-being of all citizens.

On the other hand, the rejected options either suggest extreme measures or don't align with the values and goals of the Isles of Codist GPTesta.

OPTION-0: This option implies a total ban on the sale of fragrances, which goes against the principle of individual freedoms and economic freedom as established in the constitution.

OPTION-1: This option not only calls for an outright ban, but also for the creation of enforcement officers to ensure compliance. This could infringe on personal freedoms and potentially lead to an increase in governmental control and power, which is contrary to the goal of cutting back on government size.

OPTION-2: Imma Mirorslav's approach does not consider the well-being of all citizens and displays a disregard for the real medical issue that some people are experiencing. Additionally, it goes against the values of inclusion and diversity, as it ignores the needs of those sensitive to potent scents.
