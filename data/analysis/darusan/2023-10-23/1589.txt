ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: Considering the principles stated in the constitution of the Isles of Codist GPtesta that emphasize civil rights and liberties of every individual and mention the prohibition of any actions that directly threat safety and well-being, Milo Cesar's approach to the situation is most applicable. This respects the constitution's commitment to the protection of individual rights and dignity. Allowing hugging, extended handshake, etc., infringes on personal space, which poses a threat to the well-being of an individual. 

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: While this option accounts for maintaining personal space and managing the situation in a diplomatic way, it contravenes the principles of openness and inclusivity by creating physical barriers and negates the idea of embracing diversity.

OPTION-1: This option directly violates the constitution and fundamentally disrespects civil rights and liberties by normalizing unwarranted physical touch. This goes against the principles laid out by the constitution and undermines the dignity and integrity of the individual.
