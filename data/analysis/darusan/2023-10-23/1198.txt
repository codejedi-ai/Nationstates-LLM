ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: The existing Constitution highlights the importance of public health, and the notion of conserving bodies at home for an extended period proposed by Nomfundo Glenn (Option-1) poses a significant public health risk. Also, subsidizing George Starr's beetle farm to strip the flesh off bodies (Option-2) seems too gruesome and could be met with public aversion. Therefore, Health Minister Joe Banks's recommendation of requiring bodies to be disposed of within a week offers the most viable solution which aligns with the Constitution's principles and goal of maintaining public health.

Rejected options:

OPTION-1: While respecting the mourning process is important, the potential public health risks associated with keeping deceased bodies at home for extended periods are too significant to ignore. It violates the Constitution's priority of public health.

OPTION-2: Although finding a middle ground seems appealing, using beetles to strip the flesh off bodies could be perceived as disrespectful to the deceased and their grieving families. Subsidizing this practice may lead to public outrage, thereby contradicting the goal of maintaining societal harmony as per the Constitution.
