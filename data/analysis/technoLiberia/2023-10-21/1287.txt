ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: TechnoLiberia should value and appreciate the voices of its youth. However, according to our Constitution's commitments to education and development, the focus should be on educating our young population. Boosting the education budget to create student governments within schools would provide a platform for students to voice their opinions without prematurely pushing them into the complex world of national governance. Thus, the focus remains on honing their intellectual capabilities and guiding them towards making informed decisions for our nation in the future. Meanwhile, their immediate concerns and ideas may still find a platform within their respective educational institutions.

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: Although creating a youth parliament offers an immediate platform for young voices, the long-term consequences may be problematic. Our fundamental focus should be on providing high-quality education to equip our youth with the knowledge and skills they need to contribute meaningfully to society in the future. Forcing them into political institutions prematurely might distract from their education and personal development.

OPTION-2: Raising the voting age by five years contradicts our commitments to inclusivity and representation. It would effectively silence the voices of our young population and deny them their rights to participate in the democratic process.

OPTION-3: Appointing individuals under 18 to fill a third of all cabinet positions is not only impractical, given their limited experience and understanding of complex national issues, but also infringes on the rights of experienced, dedicated individuals who have the expertise to guide our nation. Also, according to our Constitution and guiding principles, emphasis should be placed on education and not rushing their growth and development process.
