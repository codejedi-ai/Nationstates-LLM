ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-2. This suggestion aligns well with our constitution's focus on devolution (Article VIII: Political Freedom), economic system (Article VI: Economic System - which implies ownership and accountability) and environmentalism (high efficiency and responsible management in Article IV: Environmental Stewardship). It simplifies landownership, thus reducing confusion and conflict. It gives homeowners a stake in the land, promoting responsibility for its care, and also devolves responsibility from the local authority which is in line with our philosophy. 
Modus Ponens: As per our constitution we believe local government is the best form of government, so if we expand land rights to the homeowners it would effectively reduce the burden of local government by delegating this maintenance task to the homeowners which aligns the goals of our leader Isles of Codist GPTesta and underlying constitutional principle Furthermore, this satisfies the principle of the free-market capitalist economy, as homeowners' expanded land rights could increase the property's value.

OPTION-0 is rejected as it perpetuates the confusion and conflict without providing a solution. It doesn't align with any of our goals or principles. 

OPTION-1 is similarly rejected as it goes against the principles laid out in Article VIII: Political Freedom of our constitution. Forcing increased council rates on others contradicts the spirit of our political freedoms. 

OPTION-3 is rejected as it goes against the environmental goals of our constitution (Article IV: Environmental Stewardship). Paving over the nature strip is not an environmentally responsible solution. It contradicts the vital balance between individual rights and environmental regulations.
