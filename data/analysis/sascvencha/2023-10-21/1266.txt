ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-1: Stephen Watts's proposal to build separate wings for transgender prisoners is likely the most viable solution, given current circumstances. This approach, in conjunction with adequate support and protection measures, would ensure the safety of all inmates without infringing upon individual rights. It provides a balance that works towards the humane treatment of transgender individuals while maintaining a safe environment in prisons. The modus ponens for this decision can be established as follows: 'If a decision prevents threats to the well-being of inmates and upholds civil rights, such as the right to identification with a preferred gender, then that decision is in line with the constitution and policy goals.' The proposed decision to build separate wings for trans prisoners fits this criteria and thus, is the preferred option.

Rejected options:

OPTION-0: Alex Peña's input is appreciated, but deciding on prison assignments based on identified gender alone may increase security risks. The modus ponens justifying this rejection would be: 'If an approach leads to potential safety hazards, then it veers from our constitution and policy goals that emphatically endorse safety and well-being. Given its potential repercussions on the security of prisoners and overall prison management, Peña's suggestion does not clear this bar.'

OPTION-2: The notion proposed by Kristian Dawson, of erasing 'gender-identity' from our records, falls short of our emphasis on civil rights and respect for personal identification. Hence, it is not the best option. As per the modus ponens: 'If a decision alienates or disrespects a part of the population by refusing to acknowledge their chosen identity, it is not in line with our constitution and policy goals,' Dawson's idea fails to meet the mark.

OPTION-3: Falala Krauss's suggestion of societal-wide education programs is valuable in long-term, however, it does not address the immediate issue at hand. Thence, in accordance with the modus ponens: 'If a proposal tackles a future benefit but does not offer a solution to an imminent problem, it is not suitable to the immediate context.' Hence, Krauss's proposal is not the optimal choice for this particular situation.
