ANALYSIS:
OPTION-5: “Yeah... we’re not giving out our nuclear launch codes,” declares your Defense Minister, Rolan Malinovich, who has been glaring at the Merovingian delegation with a look of disgust. “However, President Moreno has a point. The imperialist parasites need to be kept in check. Tell San Vitenzo that we will agree to their request, but only if we can set up a military base on their land — and doing it correctly is going to require a lot of tax Dar Papers.”
This option aligns best with our policy goals and principles of upholding a high technological base, promoting job/opportunity creation (a new military base would necessitate hiring), and defending against threats to national and international security. Moreover, it respects San Vitenzo's concern for protection while maintaining our own sovereignty and control over the deployment and use of advanced weapon systems.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-1: Moreno's proposal entails the transfer of nuclear weapons, which presents security and ethical challenges that are inconsistent with our values of technology responsibility, transparency, and peaceful prosperity.

OPTION-3: Fufu's suggestion not only risks transferring our weapon technologies but also the control over them by sharing the launch codes. This violates our commitment to preserving peace and responsible use of technology.

OPTION-6: Prime Minister Anders Anderson's suggestion for dismantlement of our nuclear weaponry goes against our interest in maintaining a high technological base and our intent to provide a secure environment domestically and internationally.
