ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-1: Bill Pantz's view aligns with our constitution and policy goals. Considering that freedoms, including freedom of speech, are integral to our society (as detailed in our constitution), it's important that we maintain these rights. Therefore, the term 'Bigwigs' in this context is fair use in a puzzle. From a "modus ponens" perspective: if the right to free speech is protected (which it is as per our constitution), and if the use of 'Bigwigs' falls within this right (which it does according to our understanding of the context), then this usage should be allowed.

Rejected Options:
OPTION-0: Even though we uphold civil rights, Ada Bach's suggestion to fire the responsible party is an extreme measure. It fails to consider the principle of proportionality and does not respect the freedom of speech as outlined in our constitution.
OPTION-3: Dawa Gaud√≠'s proposal for mandatory sensitivity training and promoting greater diversity might seem attractive but contradicts our constitution's stand against affirmative action. We uphold meritocracy as a core value.
OPTION-4: Manny Festaux's idea to nationalize the media is directly against our constitution's safeguarding of individual freedoms and economic principles, which favor a free-market capitalist economy. Such a move also intrudes upon the freedom of information.
