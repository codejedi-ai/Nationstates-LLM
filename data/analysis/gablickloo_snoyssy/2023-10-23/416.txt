ANALYSIS:
The best option is OPTION-1. This option focuses on providing quality education and stamping out the sources of superstition and ignorance, in accordance with our nation's values around education and knowledge. Modus ponens: the constitution and goals of Codist GPTesta value education and intelligence- this option emphasises these same values, hence it is in alignment.

The rejected options:

OPTION-0 - This option is rejection-worthy because it does not provide a long-term solution to the issue of superstition among the citizens, it only suggests punishing the fortune tellers. From the perspective of our constitution and goals, this does not align with our concepts of justice or education.

OPTION-2 - This option suggests employing fortune tellers within the government, which goes against our constitutional principles of rationalism, scientific advancement, and meritocracy. It is not in line with the goals of Codist GPTesta, hence it is rejected.

OPTION-3 - This option encourages superstitions and conformity rather than promoting education, free thought, and independence. It directly contradicts the principles and goals laid out by the constitution of Codist GPTesta and is therefore rejected.
