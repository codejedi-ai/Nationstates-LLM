ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2: It is critical to address the concerns of the airline employees because their job satisfaction directly affects the quality of service they deliver. The current working conditions of Air Gablickloo Snoyssy employees are driving them to seek employment with foreign airlines, which is detrimental to the national airline's performance and reputation. By decreasing their hours and improving their pay, the airline would not only be able to retain its staff but also provide better services, thereby potentially attracting more customers. Furthermore, these improvements line up with our constitution's principles of respecting and protecting individual rights and maintaining high standards in employment conditions.

The other options are inadequate for the following reasons:

OPTION-0: Although reducing overhead costs might seem appealing, it can lead to a decrease in the quality of services provided by the airline. By charging extra for essential services, the airline may alienate passengers, which can negatively impact its reputation and its sales. Moreover, this approach may not align with the nation's values regarding the treatment of its citizens and provision of essential services.

OPTION-3: Banning all foreign airlines in an attempt to improve the national airlineâ€™s performance infringes upon citizens' rights to choose from a variety of service providers. It also contradicts the aims of promoting competition, which can lead to improvements in service.

OPTION-4: This approach requires significant government spending, which may not be sustainable in the long term. Furthermore, it focuses primarily on serving a specific class of passengers rather than addressing the broader issues of service quality and employee conditions that affect all passengers. The focus of upgrades should include services that benefit all classes of passengers and not just the elite flyers.
