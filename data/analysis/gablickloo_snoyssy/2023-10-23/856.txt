ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: While distributing the sculptures en masse to our allies might initially seem like a burden, it presents a unique diplomatic opportunity. Advertisements can highlight that these sculptures are part of Gablickloo Snoyssyian culture, thus ensuing diplomatic politeness would force allies to accept them. This strategy aligns with the goals mentioned in Article VII of the Constitution of the Isles of Codist GPTesta to preserve and share our cultural heritage. It also adheres to the news emphasizing international diplomacy and cultural exchanges. Moreover, the Isles of Codist GPTesta's values champion inclusivity, open-mindedness, and compassionate society, which can positively be exhibited by sharing aspects of our culture with our allies.

Rejection:
OPTION-2: Demolishing the sculptures does not align with our Constitutionâ€™s directive about preservation of cultural heritage (Article VII). It also goes against the values of inclusivity and open-mindedness that drive the Isles of Codist GPTesta.

OPTION-3: While repurposing the sculptures seems creative, it could potentially degrade Gablickloo Snoyssyian culture by reducing meaningful art pieces into everyday items. This doesn't align with the goals of preserving and sharing cultural heritage.

OPTION-0: Although option 0 aligns with Article VII, creating a permanent gallery of all the sculptures would consume a considerably large portion of our budget. This decision could potentially sacrifice resources that could better serve our nation elsewhere. Moreover, this approach does not take into account the potential quality or relevance of the art, violating the meritocracy held in Article II.
