ANALYSIS:
OPTION-2 is the most balanced and sensible choice. It recognizes that while there are definite situations, such as hostage negotiations and riot control, where heavy weaponry may be necessary, such tools should not be in the routine purview of local law enforcement. This supports the goal of preserving civil rights, as emphasized in the constitution of the Isles of Codist GPTesta, where it states that individual liberties are to be respected and upheld. It also aligns with our commitment to maintaining peace and well-being in our society. 

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: While Mr. Nahasapeemapetilon's concerns are valid, this option doesn't offer a concrete solution. It merely highlights the problem.

OPTION-1: Allowing local law enforcement to purchase military-grade weaponry could lead to disproportionate responses to civil affairs, potentially escalating conflict and infringing upon citizen rights. This directly contradicts the principles of our constitution, which prioritizes the protection of civil rights.

OPTION-3: Transferring all policing duties to the military could lead to an escalation of conflicts and the infringement of civil liberties, deviating from our nation's commitment to uphold civil rights and political freedoms as expressed in our constitution.
