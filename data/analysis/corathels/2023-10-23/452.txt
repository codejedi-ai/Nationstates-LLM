ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: It aligns with the constitution's mandate to uphold the rights and identities of all its citizens, including the protection of women's rights, as set out in Article I and Article X. It provides a balance between the right to free speech and the right to access medical services without hindrance or distress--a key aspect of maintaining peace and well-being within our society as highlighted in the preamble.

Rejected options:

OPTION-1: Although it argues for the protection of free speech, it overlooks the potential distress and harm that such protests can cause to individuals seeking medical services, specifically abortion. This goes against the constitution's principle to stand against any forms of extremism that threatens the well-being and peace of our society.

OPTION-2: This option directly opposes the constitution's principles of civil rights and liberties. Also, calling an action immoral based on religious beliefs directly contradicts the constitution's principle to create an inclusive society under Article II, and regulate religious practices under Article IX.

OPTION-3: The proposition to outlaw the anti-abortion movement entirely would infringe upon the right to free speech and freedom of religion, contradicting the Constitution's Articles I and IX. It will also create an intolerant society contrary to our goal to foster an inclusive society. The suggested penalties for religious anti-choice advocates also go against the constitution's principles of justice and fairness in its Justice code.
