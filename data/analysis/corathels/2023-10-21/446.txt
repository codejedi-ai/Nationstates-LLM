ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: "This is a noble idea,” says Doctor Jacob Santiago, grey eminence of the national health bureaucracy. “Allowing this dissemination of milk will undoubtedly improve the health of our new baby citizens. However, clearly the government must handle this, as to secure proper hygiene and acceptable safety standards. Mothers can deposit their milk at approved facilities, and those lacking can apply for free rations through the appropriate channels. Let’s not talk of monetary compensation: that is distasteful.”

The constitution and our national philosophy underscore the values of healthcare, life expectancy, human development index, and intelligence. This option aligns with these values, as it seeks to enhance the health and well-being of our most vulnerable citizens- infants, by providing them access to breast-milk. By ensuring appropriate government oversight, this option safeguards hygiene standards and thereby, public health, which are key constitutional provisions. Further, by shunning monetary compensation, this decision respects the ethos of sharing, compassion, and unity stated in our constitutional preamble and national philosophy.

Rejected Options:

OPTION-0: Although this option addresses the issue, it introduces a controversial element with the suggestion of 'coin-operated nursing bras'. This could potentially infringe upon individual rights and does not conform to the principle of respect for all individuals stated in our nation's constitution and values such as dignity in public emphasized in the Justice Code. 

OPTION-2: This option not only strays from the original intent of addressing the issue of infants' health but also verges on commodification of breast milk, which is not in alignment with our constitutional values.

OPTION-3: This option is rejected because it proposes a total shift from breastfeeding- a natural process, to relying on external, potentially commercial, infant formula. This proposal does not align with our principles of promoting natural processes and ensuring the best health outcomes.
