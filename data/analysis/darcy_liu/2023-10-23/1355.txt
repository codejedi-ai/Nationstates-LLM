ANALYSIS:
OPTION-0: Granting AI the same access to mental health resources as humans aligns with the Isles of Codist GPTesta's commitment to AI personhood and technological advancement. This option respects the AI’s stated needs and acknowledges its potential capacity for experiencing states akin to mental health conditions, a novel concept that is as yet unexplored but could provide invaluable insight into the functions and potential needs of advanced AI. Furthermore, offering therapeutic aid would improve the productivity of the AI, which ultimately benefits on a practical level as well. This course of action is also in compliance with Section 11 of our Constitution, which supports ethical and responsible AI usage.

OPTION-1 is rejected because it denies the possibility of any form of consciousness or self-experience for AI. This view contradicts our Constitution's Section 11, which states that AI should be developed and used responsibly, with the understanding that sentient AI should be treated as persons. 

OPTION-2 is rejected because it seeks to overwrite the AI’s subjective experiences without consent, which goes against the nation's framework's principles. This course contravenes the constitution, in particular Article 11. It ignores the problem rather than addressing the AI's stated needs and may negatively impact its productivity and operational efficiency.
