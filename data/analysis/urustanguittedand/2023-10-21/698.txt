ANALYSIS:
OPTION-1: The proposal put forward by Elephant County Deputy Sheriff Freya Wu is by far the best option. The introduction of background checks, a review of medical records, and a gun licensing system aligns with our nation's commitments to protecting civil liberties while ensuring public safety. This approach respects the constitutional right to bear arms, but it also acknowledges that this right must be balanced against the need to protect individuals, especially law enforcement, from preventable harm. Similarly, by focusing on regulating access to firearms rather than outright prohibition, this proposal aligns with our national emphasis on free enterprise and free competition. Adopting the proposed reforms will invariably lead to an enriched sense of security for our citizens, restoring the faith in 'Sisu', the perpetual strive to overcome adversity and challenges.

On the other hand;

OPTION-0: The justification presented by Lancelot Räikkönen fails to regard the larger implication of unregulated gun ownership. A mentally unstable individual with access to firearms poses a direct threat to others' safety, infringing upon their right to life, liberty, and security. Consequently, retaining unrestricted access to firearms fails to align with our duties outlined in the constitution to safeguard our citizens' well-being.

OPTION-2: The proposal by Lebron Dylan can result in potential social disparities, with access to firearms exclusive to the affluent section of the society, contradicting our commitment to equality and economic freedom. Having firearms accessible to only the wealthy undermines our societal beliefs in fairness and equal opportunity.

OPTION-3: Rosalia Locke’s approach inclines towards absolute government control, invalidating individuals' right to bear arms. Monopolizing firearm access to the government contradicts our free-market economy principles and infringes on individual freedoms, diverging from our constitution's core mandates.
