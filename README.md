# Introduction
This project involves building a natural language processing system that uses a large language model (LLM) to make decisions based on data from the NationStates website. We will use the Hugging Face Transformer library to build our model and train it on a dataset consisting of questions asked by users and corresponding answers retrieved from the NationStates API. Our goal is to create a system that can accurately predict the correct answer to new user queries.

# Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Python programming
Familiarity with deep learning concepts and libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
Access to a GPU with at least 16GB of VRAM (optional but recommended for faster training times)
An internet connection to download the required datasets and libraries
Dataset Collection
We need to collect a dataset containing pairs of questions and their corresponding answers obtained from the NationStates API. You can scrape this data manually or write a script to automate the process. Make sure to follow any usage guidelines provided by the website and avoid scraping too frequently to prevent being blocked. Once you have collected the data, preprocess it into a suitable format for inputting into the LLM. This may involve cleaning up the text, converting it to lowercase, removing special characters, etc. Save the processed data in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.
